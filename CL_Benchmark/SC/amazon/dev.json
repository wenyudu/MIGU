My reading is that the author has tried many of these services, and offers some tips on which ones are qualified.It is not much of a book though, as its 100 pages can easily be compacted to 50, since the publisher uses double and triple line spacing. It's not an introduction for the beginner because it's too skimpy. A beginner is probably best served by first reading other books about promotions and then gathering tips from this book on how to cut costs. The techniques presented are accurate and elementary.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: If You Want Orange Hair Instead Of Gray This Product's For You\nText: I've now tried several Just For Men colors.

Her voice sometimes seems not to be flowing with the music, and it seems as if she is being held back from really displaying her talent. The music also doesn't flow, and it seems as if the musicians can't decide what tune to play next. The whole album is substanceless and the songs aimless. Still, I have just purchased her other ablum, because believe she has the talent to create an album as good as Sarah Brightman's, so I've given her a second chance.

The authors characters seem to be totally different people. Next with the addition of Luke and Leia's foreplay, I almost couldn't stomach the implications. Even after taking into account that the author did not know where the story was going in later movies, I found his writing style difficult to enjoy due to its simplicity and lack of good character development.

Herbert had a way of saying more by implication than by actual description. \"House Atreides\" is just plain bland by comparison. Some of the descriptive metaphors wouldn't be worthy of a freshman creative writing student (the bull falling over like a spaceship, for instance). Most of the characters and situations are described or implied in other Dune works. In most cases, they are not better served by being fleshed out. Ix, for example, is a much more provactive and interesting place because it was never explicitly described in the other Dune books; the reader is left to imagine and fill in the possibilities. \"Dune\" is a book that most people grow into. \"House Atreides\" is, regretfully, one that you'll have to dumb down for.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: DON'T BUY IF USING ATV FOR MULTIPLE PURPOSES!\nText: This system works, but it does NOT install and uninstall easily.

The regulator knob has a very sloppy feel and a finite number of poorly placed levels rather than the smooth, continuous settings on my 10 year old Coleman dual mantle lantern. Last but not least, the regulation of the gas flow is very poor at the higher settings, producing a sputtering sound and an annoying, flickering light.

The real weakness behind this album is not the production, or evolution of the band, but the strength of the songs. This was becoming obvious on \"Everyday,\" and continues here. There are just no songs that instantly capture your attention here. An acquired taste? Perhaps. But this band was always known for its catchy tunes, and innovative instrumentation.

As a result the divorce rate is well over fifty percent within the first ten years of a marriage.

In his book \"Finding Your Million Dollar Mate\" author Randy Pope proposes a Biblically based system for dating.One of the high points of the book is his clear explanation and sound reasoning for why you should wait for the right person before engaging in sexual activity. In a world that supports sexual activity at earlier and earlier ages teenagers often don't want to accept \"because it's wrong\" as a reason for waiting. Randy Pope provides a positive answer for why you should wait.

Consequently, the visual and sonic quality of this DVD is not immaculate, although I think it is not nearly as bad as some people make it sound.

There are selections for pop, jazz, rock, classical, etc. The only negative things I can say about it is that occasionally it skips and gets stuck when playing a CD much like the old phonographs with needles would do. This does not happen very often though and perhaps it is not the machine but a CD that has not been taken care of properly.

David seamlessly blends classical technique with pop and jazz sensibilities, and makes it sound so relaxed. This is a live recording and it sounds as if David were sitting in your living room with you. The recording and performance are flawless and yet the songs remain comfortable and relaxed. David performs original, jazz and classical compositions on this disc. Original pieces Blue Counterpoint and On the Way are refreshing and uplifting. David's arrangememnts of Birdland and Spain are funky and exctiting and his performance of Bach's 6th Cello Suite is also dynamic and expressive. If you like great fingerstyle guitar (and everything in between), David Cullen delivers it all with taste and great technique!\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: Great!\nText: I really liked this book, i gave it to everyone of my friends to read. i have one friend that hates reading and he read it the whole way through.

In comparison this Epson is awful. It prints at the wrong scale and in the wrong position on the page time and time again. I've worked through various settings and print from various file formats and programs and it prints correctly about 10% of the time. In addition, the paper feed is incredibly poor, requiring sheets to be repositioned for every page printed. An absolute nightmare to my workflow. Maybe my printer is a lemon, but regardless, the Epson software is nothing special either.Maybe for the discounted price this printer is worth it for some - but not me.

As she sends him mixed signals, he becomes more smitten, until she suddenly breaks up with him. The end has a redeeming twist in which Tom realizes that he wasn't exactly the attentive lover that Summer needed, and their chemistry wasn't all that perfect either.

If you're using an old slow card, and not a high-speed Lexar or Sandisk Ultra card, you can notice the difference in upgrading to a faster card! If you take photos in rapid succession, the write time is much faster, and maybe even battery life is longer since the camera spends less time writing. (Of course, the quality of your photos will remain exactly the same.)However, the USB card reader that comes with this Lexar card is NOT compatible with other brands of flash cards! It works fine with the Lexar card, but DOES NOT WORK with other brands such as my Sandisk or Canon cards. Keep in mind that if you have a USB 2.0 port, and a USB 2.0 device, your photos will transmit from your camera to your computer MUCH faster. (And most digital cameras are still the older USB 1.1, so a card reader makes a huge difference in transfer time.)\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: Personal Brew and Go\nText: It is a little bigger than I was expecting, but a good value for the coffeemaker and travel mug.

The plot is pejorative, riddled with holes, and at times quite boring, and the denouement is incredibly trite and predictable. The story is semi-interesting, but is nothing you haven't seen in a Lifetime movie, and it makes you wonder why the two leads signed onto this project at all, other than the chance to work together again. The movie is supposed to be a mix of drama, suspense, and action, but in its attempt to incorporate all three, it falls short in every respect.

I was royally offended to find that that 96 page book included 56 pages of a wordy and drawn-out kid's story that my own kids (who love books) never once sat through, and pictures of 28 individual toys and a marina complex of boats, docks, etc. There were, however, plans for only 6 of the individual toys, and only about half of the simplistic marina designs. The rest were listed as plans for sale; the whole thing felt more like a catalog than a book about building toys...

There were moments of interesting drama such as when a homophobic teacher \"outs\" the young 16 year old narrator, Greg. The Jesus/Judas parallel with the two loves of Greg's life Kit and Philippe nearly worked and at least made the novel more interesting but the conclusion was as messy to read as the events it described.

All the songs are done with punk rock edginess and intensity but the maturity and coherence of the gorup make for mellower song structures. Frusciante is at the top of his game, his riffing and strumming is finger licking good, solidified by the electricity of flea's bass work. Kiedis continues in the vein of californication's 'around the world' and 'scar tissue' with his voice seeped in bittersweet. The mix is strengthened by double tracking of guitars and extensive use of keys time checked by solid percussion backing.

The charm and charisma of the Next Generation players is not nearly as evident here as in the next two films. On the bright side, Generations has its moments which still make it a very worthwhile and intellegent film. William Shatner steals the show in his last outing as \"Captain James T. Kirk\", and the interplay between he and Stewart is great. Also, the special effects are top-notch, particularly the crash landing of the Enterprise.

The Innkeeper's Song is a beautiful book, but certainly better for 30 than 13 -- unless, perhaps, for a 13-year-old who has already had to deal with death. It concerns attempts to cheat death by magic, and the strange and unforeseen consequences, both good and ill, of raising a drowned young woman from the dead. The book is also noteworthy for a varied and unforgettable cast of characters who take turns narrating the story, giving the reader many perspectives on the same events and aiding suspense by concealing certain facts until the narrator shifts to someone in the know.

Excellent graphics and great activities but there certainly should be more verbal or graphic reward as incentives to make the child want to further pursue the game. Kids of this age react much better to more frequent reward...and this game just disappoints for computer active, advanced children. Other Disney products have been better received.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: great premise, poor follow-through\nText: I thought this was a great premise for a book, but the execution was more than a little disappointing. There are just too many ways a civilization can change for anything to seem realistic. Just as the black plague was a historical turning point that ended European influence in this book, couldn't something else have changed the world the writer created into something completely unrecognizable? The world the writer created here seemed too much like the world we know today, with a different accent -- like throwing curry powder on a food to make it \"Indian\" or chili powder on something else to make it \"Mexican.\" I did enjoy the earlier chapters, but they seemed more appealing on their own than having to follow the conceit of having them reborn over time. Getting familiar with the world was difficult enough -- to have to relearn who was who in the story was more work than I was prepared for.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Title: superlative performances.\nText: You will not find any superstar pianists on this CD but in my view the pieces in this collection have rarely been better performed.

Discs one and two are both stellar, but the chronologically-ordered set gradually goes to pot towards the end, with BJ (possibly the least coolest singer ever) blathering and crooning his way through some of the '70s worst pop sludge. Still, this set is worth it simply because the first two discs are quite good, and Maxine Brown's previously unreleased take on \"Baby Cakes\" on the third disc will simply blow you away.

The connection to horseracing is small, but so what? I especially liked the dynamic among Logan & his assistants as well as his protectors. I think the book is only worth 3.5 stars because of the hard-to-believe ending & Logan's unexplained reticence to involve the police--when he'd recognized some of his attackers--and his girlfriend is a constable.

If Ms Deveraux' purpose was to lay a basis for future sequels, she did a good job of giving us thumbnail characterizations. The book left me wanting to know the stories of several of the other characters. My favorite Deveraux book is Knight in Shining Armor and that heroine was also showered with fortuitous circumstances. The difference between the two books is that in Knight, we have already suspended our beliefs and accepted the time travel so it isn't such a leap to accept additional beneficence. But the modern setting of Mulberry Tree requires us to leap back and forth between reality and fantasy too often.

Mr. Holt begins in his preface to point out that he originally wanted to focus on the election of 1844. That section of the book is truly well-written. Similarly, there are other sections of the book when Mr. Holt does warm to his subject, but the rest of it is rather boring and scattered.

Its hauntingly beautiful and simple guitar work, and a slower tempo than the Beatles' original version allow the listener to savor the lyrics, as only Shawn Colvin can so sweetly and heart-breakingly deliver them.

We have a local hockey/ice arena that allows people to walk laps during the cold winter months, and I have never had a problem keeping her warm because she shares my body heat.If I had a complaint, it would be that it is somewhat complicated to wrap and tie, and generally requires some help to keep it from getting on the floor. This isn't a big deal in our house, but in public it can be difficult to keep the fabric from getting on the ground. That being said, its just something that takes a little practice, and the more we use it, the better we get at it.

Some of the things he thinks are downright funny.His friend Sparky is always thinking of ways to make money. These ideas put Luther in some humorous situations and in one almost serious trouble.Sparky thinks Luther has it made because Luther has a job and his mother is a big time landlord who makes lots of money. But Luther is slowly facing the truth about his mother and her business.The humor in this story almost conceals its difficult coming-of-age situation.

It is impossible for her not to know about Galveston; in fact, I have an ungenerous hunch that she modeled this book after Isaac's Storm, Erik Larsen's account of the Galveston hurricane.

I have been tracking my expenses for a year now and I was hoping that the budgeting section would provide a good alternative to that (since it is a bit of a burden), but there was actually very little information on how to set up the \"simple\" budget he is talking about. For those of you who need a better and more in-depth approach to budgeting and debt-reduction, I would highly recommend \"Debt-Proof Living\" by Mary Hunt (BTW she is also a Christian). It's a much better resource. For those of you who need basic information on investments, car loans, mortgages, etc, this is a good start and will provide the basics without overwhelming you, then you can get more information later as you need it.

Maybe he just liked the sound of his own voice.Worst of all was the scene around 50 minutes in where the coroner describes the state of the remains he received and what he examined. I honestly wonder if the coroner was as mentally diluted as Treadwell. The man seems to almost relish in the gore while he overacts throughout the entire scene.

Choreography, with rare exception, is a collection of banal and interchangeable bravura steps which don't allow development of much individuality. Sometimes dancers of Paris Opera Ballet perform like technically perfect clones, sucking all life and emotions out of choreography. This is one of these performances. Libretto is absurd too.The whole impression is of a museum piece valuable for historians and conoiseures: it gives a perfect example of how \"routine\" Russian imperial court ballet entertainment must look like.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: Horrible People, but also Irreverent and Funny People\nText: \"Horrible Bosses\" falls into a category of irreverent and ironic humor that is all the rage in American cinemas and television.

The author is not decrying medicine, health care, or related technologies. He does, however, state that other things to consider are the patient's age, the value of improving the person's quality of life, (is their condition terminal?), and financial costs to the patient and her family. For example, should an 85 year old person with a chronic heart condition be able to receive a heart transplant if it would only extend the patient's life a few months, and the surgery might actually kill the person?If a family member is in a \"consistent vegetative state\", should the family keep the body alive at all costs?Callahan asks hard questions and points out that there are no simple answers.

And the concept for that park is breath-taking, but I felt it was under-utilized. The park is so clever that dozens of twists and turns leap to mind that could have added suspense to this novel. The plot is predictable and you know who the bad guy is almost immediately. My other complaint with the story is the lack of fleshing out John Doe. I kept wanting it to be Eric Nightingale come for revenge on the commercialization of his dream, but we never get a good look at who John Doe is. All this being said, I still recommend this book as a fast paced and fun read, but I much prefer the Lincoln/Child colaborations.

Critics held mixed views of some of Kenton's work, but I have yet to hear of anyone who would give this less than five stars.If you have not yet listened to Stan Kenton, this is a great place to start. 'Cuban Fire' is energetic and innovative without going off the edge of experimentation. I have come to seriously enjoy Kenton's music on many albums, but this is good enough to be one of my 'desert island' selections. Even the bonus tracks are welcome, as they essentially maintain the style of the original album.

Using realism, Twain lets people know how he thinks and shows that people can change. Realism is utilized to allow all people to be able to relate and understand what is going on in the novel. I believe everyone at one point in their life should read this novel.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: HORRIBLE!!!\nText: I bought these headphones at a sam goody.

When Ilse speaks German, it sounds like straight out of a dictionary - no grammar knowledge whatsoever.

A history piece presented by 21-st century men. The film failed to show customs and cruelty of early 18 century. Some parts are really lengthy and dull with no meaningful impact on action. Binoche is sailing around in her skirts without showing open passion either to her husband (except the unnecessary and out of taste nude scene) or to the murderer. Seems that she only pretends that she really cares about the guys. I guess she just looks for a strange way to escape thoughts about hanging herself because of boring island life. I have a feeling that the whole \"male\" cast (mostly unknown actors) is poking around Binoche. Her suppose-to-be husband and that other guy are of no match to her as actors. If you are up to a real character played by Binoche you better stick to films where a) she plays with great names as Fiennes and b) she plays less morbid character.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Title: fun resource\nText: This book is filled with great resources for fun times with kids.

The recipes have made me think of new combinations or add a little spice here and there that I might not have otherwise. The only shortcoming is mixing some of the one year old recipes with those of 9 months up to 1 year, which means the recipes with milk (and eggs depending upon your pediatrician's advice) might not really be suitable for a while longer. It's a bit confusing and limits your options in that age range.

What was Cain thinking?!?\nText: 'Career in C Major' is a surprisingly weak short novel by James Cain. While it is not poorly written, the book's entire premise is utterly absurd. We have a middle class, middle-aged man in 1930s New York City married to a posh, semi-neurotic wench. The wife believes she has sacrificed a promising career in opera to get married and have children, and now wants to return to opera. Okay, so far so good. But then it turns out that the husband, without any singing background whatsoever, is a naturally gifted and reluctant Caruso who upstages his (very envious) wife! I am surprised such nonsense was dished out by the normally wonderful Cain. No doubt such rubbish was published only because of his reputation.Bottom line: dreadful.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: Entertaining\nText: I got this for my husband for a Christmas gift.

It felt like a timeless story that could have been written only yesterday instead of in the 1930's. It also could have been written by a much older, experienced person instead of a young girl of 23 years. It is a gentle, sad story that might have been typical of small town life. It was very refreshing to feel submerged in the slow pace and emotion of life in a long gone era. The story touched me in an unexpected way, and I know I will long remember the characters and their individual stories. Timing is everything when making the choice to read this wonderful book.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Title: Zizi's masterpiece\nText: In my opinion, Zizi Possi is one of the finest voices of contemporary Brazilian music. Her high-pitched, moody vocals are always compelling. This 1991 recording represented a shift in her career: that's when she decided to leave her usual label to be able to sing what she really wanted and the way she wanted, with much more restrained arrangements than before: here just piano, cello, charango and percussion. And the result is really great, since Zizi's voice is so melodic that it doesn't need much orchestration. The repertoire ranges between heartfelt ballads and more raucous rhythms. Some of the best cuts are the exquisite cover of Chico Buarque's \"Eu te amo\" and her very personal version of \"Com que roupa\", a Brazilian classic from the 20s.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: What Government?\nText: It is astounding how learned and educated people, like Professor Wills, can spend years reading the Founders and yet miss the main point: that an arbitrary and irresponsible government, such as we have now, where administrative agencies write, enforce, and judge their own laws, is the very definition of tyranny.

Unfortunately for them, and ultimately for us, the albums they are producing are sounding strikingly similar. Rather than being true to their roots, many are releasing cookie cutter albums that are attempting to appeal to the same target audience: younger teens who watch Idol. Being a somewhat older viewer, I was looking for Katherine McPhee to release a CD solidly rooted in what I loved her for, standards and showtunes. Elliot Yamin's strength embraced jazz and R&B flavored compositions. Although there are sprinklings of these styles, his CD appears to be, and Katherine's as well, a compilation of various styles with no strong thread throughout. Chris Daughtry and Kelly Pickler excepted, this mishmash of styles may appeal to the young viewer, but I think I'll pass on building my American Idol collection in favor of the tried and true singers of the American songbook.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Title: Mixed\nText: I have used this system before, so I know my towing safety will increase.

The video itself is different from the original, using different shots, editing and takes. The alternate version of the \"Don't Speak\" video was interesting. This version is 100% concert footage instead of the original version having scenes of the band members acting out their frustration towards Gwen. I loved the behind the scenes vignettes of various photo shoots, video shoots and recording sessions. My favorites were the footage of the Tragic Kingdom album shoot, the making of \"Trapped in a Box\", filming \"Excuse Me Mr\". and recording \"Oi to the World\".

Luckily, Lowe doesn't give us a saint and that's the saving grace of his first novel.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: Interesting story\nText: This is an intersting biography of a Scottish man who loved God.

It doesn't really leak or drip (this hole), but when I sat it on my desk, I kept wondering where the water ring was coming from.That having been said, the only other suggestion I could have is that the snapping lid (that makes it spill-proof, but not drip-proof) fit more snugly. Other than these two relatively minor issues, it's a great tumbler. It keeps my coffee hot (I haven't tried out cold on it,yet), cleans easily and looks great. It gets jostled quit a bit during my morning commute, but doesn't spill (it hasn't been knocked to the floorboards, yet, traffic isn't that rough.)Overall, I'd say if you're looking for a high-quality travel cup that keeps things hot for quite some time, this is your best bet.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Title: Great design\nText: Works great, keeps both batteries charged.Great design for diesel trucks with two batteries would recommend for diesel truck owners who don,t drive much un the winter time.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: The Math Video Tutor\nText: The video is good each topic is explained clearly and precisely.

I actually think in the books that Monk is presented more obsessive and compulsive and more difficult to deal with than on the TV show. This storyline gives Natalie a little romantic bit too. And as always, Natalie is telling the story from her perspective. It actually gives you insight into Natalie's thoughts and feelings as she moves through her days with Monk that you don't get from the show.

And Duckie... my poor poor Duckie.The acting in this movie is great for the most part. The supporting cast especially. Jon Cryer and Annie Potts made this movie. And if only James Spader didnt look 30, I would say he was perfectly cast as well. Ringwald and McCarthy did alright with their parts, not great, but not badly either. I also thought this script lacked something other John Hughes movies seemed to have. It just didnt grasp me as much. Basically, this is a good movie to watch on a movie night with the girls.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Title: Great Bluetooth accessory for Streets and Trips and Pharos GPS\nText: The Bluetooth dock has plenty of power and works great in my car.

(One plot description mentions that the sorority girls order their \"pledges\" to make skimpy costumes.) But this \"movie\" contains neither sorority house nor scandal. No dialogue either. The picture is instead merely the amateurish taping of an \"emcee\" on a stage (no audience is ever shown) with several girls who take turns removing their tops and jiggling a bit. What did it cost to make this picture? Well, if the girls were lucky and were hired for $50 each (and actually got paid), the emcee worked for free, the camera man got a case of beer, and they slipped the janitor $20 to let them in the auditorium for a couple of hours . . . they overspent.The only scandal is that this production was ever marketed.

Perhaps if the role of Frank Cross, the modern Scrooge, would have been portrayed by other actor, the movie wouldn't have been so entertaining, and that is the sign of a good actor. Every actor that can make better a movie with his/her performance deserves to be called a great actor.

Where this was deliberately and stringently enforced due to wartime secrecy. The book gives a backdrop's depth to that strange, wonderful society.

You could take a marker and black out the profanity and the book would improve, not be worse, except for all the little magic marker spots throughout the book.

All the comparisons with other bands made by the other reviewers are spot on - just this isn't as good as any of them.

Although her character was written as 2 dimentional and left no room for any depth or development, she did give an almost \"oscar-worthy\" performance when she slammed the jawbreaker on the table while trying to intimidate one of the girls. You go Pam! I watched in discomfort as Pam (who so brilliantly played \"Jackie\" in \"Jackie Brown\") tried to no avail to bring her lame character to life. I only saw the boredom in her eyes. The entire time i viewed this piece, i wanted to take over for the director and do this film some justice. There were so many opportunities to make this movie work but it seems as though the filmmakers had a creative blockage holding them back.

As a hiker's unit, it's good to know you can still get a bearing with the digital compass and know your approximate ascent rate with the barometer even without a clear sky view.Now, the downside. Locking in is sometimes tediously slow, both on foot or in the vehicle. An external antenna would help, but there is no provision for one, and keeping the unit properly orineted is a bit of a trick.

The Great Gatsby was a very short and readable novel, that didn't confuse your mind with incomprehensible jumble of psychedelic words pasted together to make a nice literary mosaic (still hammering on Ulysses). The Great Gatsby provided a nice window for looking at the pre-depression era of the 1920s lifestyle on the east coast, and also portrayed a vibrant narrative of a love-stricken psychotic fool within all of us given the right circumstances. The culmination of related events at the end is well worth the minimal effort required to read this book.

Doctorow's slavish dedication to the most prurient aspects put me off so much I was ready to put it down. But there was just enough interest in the story line that I kept going, and overall it ended up being worth it.The prose style is choppy, sort of like Cormac McCarthy but without the paragraph spacing. The use of historical characters is believable and the storyline surrounding 'Coalhouse' Walker was gripping.Beyond the weird prose and the need to incorporate various descriptions of bodily fluids, I also didn't care for the appearance and then disappearance of characters that initially seemed to be 'main'.

The most notable one is that Gordon came up the Chesapeake as a commodore with a small fleet very similar to the one that Hornblower led into the Baltic. (What the author finds suspicious is that Forester wrote a naval history of this period that glosses over this incident, perhaps due to the similarities with Hornblower.)

The wood blades don't even have a problem with treated wood. The first metal cutting blade I \"retired\" was after cutting countless metal siding pieces, and finally some angle iron. When it began to slow down, I found that most of the teeth had been worn down. That was a lot of cutting in some difficult material. A few years ago I bought a Bosch jig saw, that came with the blades. When I began using it, I could not believe it kept doing the job for so long, and I've been using jig saws for almost 40 years. The same blade has been used for months at a time. Highly recommend giving Bosch blades a try, as the amount of work they put out is unreal.

You will be able to finish many projects with these blades.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: R&B Remix to Switch is all you need.\nText: I hate the original. I'll be point blank.

However it does have some new takes on some of the old classic hikes such as Seven Falls, Rattlesnake Trail, etc. It is very detailed on how to get to the trails, and how to make the proper turns on the trial.

Not that there is really a problem with religion, but there are others topics in life that could be addressed. I wouldn't want to listen to a CD that was all about how the singer got dumped by his girlfriend and how he can't live through life anymore or how he was picked on in high school and he is still depressed and angry, etc. etc.They did, however, become a bit more lyrically creative than their self-title album.

Of course my tot spends most of the time drinking water from the detachable whale instead of actually twisting the red dial to make water flow, but fun all the same. I bought the same product for my nephew and he enjoys the toy too. The only flaw is that the clear plastic tub part that the ducky floats in is a little thin and will be susceptible to cracking.

The technology is completely implausible, the plot is nonexistent, and the characters are poorly developed. (If you thought the characters in the first MI lacked depth, wait till you see MI:2).

While Gabriel Yared's score for The English Patient was dramatic and brilliant, his score for City of Angels is less interesting. Also on the list is \"Iris\" by the Goo Goo Dolls. The Bad: Jimi Hendrix (Great guitarist, but not a great work), John Lee Hooker (Haven't heard much of his music, not that great), Jude (Boring and pointless), Eric Clapton (A great guitarist. This song is upbeat, yet slow). The Good: Peter Gabriel is back in prime form with \"I Grieve\" (Smooth and stylistic). Sarah McLachlan (Not my favorite artist, but I could stand to listen to this one). Paula Cole (Her songs get old after awhile and this may, too, but for now it's fresh). U2 starts the album off with a stylistic peice that almost bookends with Gabriel's. The best on the album, however, is \"Uninvited\" by Alanis Morissette.

They told a story, drawing the outline, but never really painting the picture. It was neither descriptive nor imaginative.The main character, Lauren, was a total bore. They wrote her up in this pathetic victim role, but not once did I feel for her, empathize with her. She was beyond naive; she was plain stupid. The small glimmering hope was that in the end she would evolve and learn something, but they dashed and mutilated that one opportunity to redeem the book.Manny was the one character with which I sympathized and they totally scapegoated and reemed him. He is the only character that popped amongst the one-dimensional cast. He made great observations and had the only deep introspective moments, but they shafted his growth in a failed attempt to make Lauren, Ms. Victim, look better.The ending was as bad as the rest of the book. The characters were in the exact same place they started.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: No Definitions\nText: The editors' introductory essay does everything but define visual rhetorics. They define some major semiotic concepts from Roland Barthes and C.S. Peirce and, for some reason, the concept of intertextuality. But nowhere in the introduction, or in their own chapters, do they provide a definition for visual rhetorics.For that, the reader must skip to Chapter 3,\"The Rhetoric of Visual Arguments\" by J Anthony Blair. However, Blair has a very specific focus--argument--so his definition comes with its own limitations. The rest of the essays offer a decent sense of how to apply visual rhetoric, and Sonya K Foss in the final chapter also attempts a definition. Four stars for these essays.Two stars for the book as a whole. The editors ruined the chapters with their odd subheadings, and I just cannot get over their confusing writing in the introduction and their complete failure to fulfill the promise made in the title of the book.

Rather than clarifying differences between Marxist, liberal, postmodern and other feminisms, the descriptions blurred the distinctions and failed to emphasize the ways in which liberal feminism has been challenged on different and sometimes competing grounds by the alternatives. The result may reflect reality--feminism has become an eclectic mix of ideas--but the lack of clarity about how each type emerged and why makes the book less than helpful as a basis on which to build a course.

Others came -- Ruthanna Boris, Mia Slavenska, Nina Novak -- but my memory of ballet is full of these early performances and those early dancers. It is inspiring to see them in this film, as full of love for their art as they were when performing.There is one area where I disagre slightly. I remember Nina Novak in the chorus, and she had charisma. You watched her. When she was given more important roles, you continued to watch her. What she did in her private life was irrelevant; she drew the eye.This is a must-see for every lover of ballet who is curious about how it started in America, and became the center of interest that it holds today.Baronova is astonishing!\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Title: Great Product Fast shipping\nText: I ordered three cases of these and out of 600 cd cases none of them were damaged.

Instead of the complicated machinations that were present in the 1990's series, every episode consists of Batman stopping a villain from his lame, predictable scheme. Even the intro theme song sucks. However, there are some watchable episodes in this series (especially in the later seasons). I liked the Batman-Superman team up (when all else fails, that's a good way to get ratings). In conclusion, this is not the worst cartoon ever, but the 1990's series puts this to shame.

I picked it up chiefly due to a reference Scorsese makes to it in A Personal Journey. Certainly, Divorce Italian Style is a farce but the emotions and events it contains are ones with which all of us can relate--even though none of us have a need for a Italian \"divorce.\" One also can appreciate the mystique which European films had--as compared to the more stodgy state of American cinema--during that period. I've always loved Marcello Mastroianni and his efforts here are outstanding. He plays his role perfectly and is a figure of both contempt and admiration. All of the acting, however, is great. The plot unwinds slowly but does not end predictably (on the whole).

This particular postcard guide focuses on fantasy postcards, which are a particular favorite of mine. He coveres all the basics: fairies, nursery rhymes, dressed animals, mermaids, teddy bears, Santas, Krampus, nudes, death fantasies, Halloween, Hold-To-Light, and a whole host of other types of weird and wonderful subjects.As well, Mashburn gives us a comprehensive history of postcards and collecting, covering the seven eras of postcards. He discusses the various types, how to date them, grade them, and value them. Since the book was written in '96, his prices do not always reflect current online auction prices, but that's understandable.

By itself quite a feat. However, what truly bugs me is that for the SIX WEEKS before the battery actually went dead, an annoying little icon had been blinking in my taskbar, warning me that the battery is low. It's good to know that in 6 weeks I'll have to replace the battery, but I'd really prefer it if I could switch that icon off. If that wasn't enough, at irregular intervals (sometimes only ONE MINUTE apart) a blue little window (the size of a big stamp) moves into view, ALSO telling me my battery is low.If I'd known this in advance, I wouldn't have bought this keyboard/mouse set.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Title: my favorite oldham album\nText: but not my favorite palace album. That would be There is No One. Anyway, I just spent too much time checking out the reviews for James Blunt, and was befuddled at how many people passionately love him, when he obviously isn't that good. I really think what's going on there is that people want him to be deep and a genius so they make him one-so they get to listen to \"deep\" music without having to be challenged in any way. I know music is personal, but Blunt is tripe. But here, with Mr. Oldham, I could understand how opinions could defer so widely. His music is difficult, and therefore when you like it, it is really a personal, intimate thing. I love this album, and maybe even if you don't you could understand how someone could, unlike Mr. Blunt's pablum.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: This is a scary book.\nText: I couldn't help but notice that most of the positive reviews came from Tennessee folks.

The cord is very short (to keep kids from strangulation I'm guessing) so it's hard to pull. With the wheels it's also hard to store this on the shelf with their other toys, so if I were to do it again I would go with a wooden block set and then buy a better-designed wagon separately.

Half of the movie about what the psycho thinks that the FBI agent played by Demi Moore does not have enough time to resolve the main question - who the killer was. The only dicovery she makes is that it is not who she thought. It is one of those movies that you think they finished in the middle. It has some good sceens and I personally liked Demi's performance. The funny thing was how Demi got her first and the only suspect - by pure intuition she was so sure about it. My objection is that the movie is not that much about investigation, but it is about the way the psychos think, this is what the movie promotes.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: A slog\nText: Philip Roth is one of my favorite authors.

As someone who has been through a similar situation, I was truly touched. I watch it every chance I get. If you want a beautiful story of a growing relationship, then this is the film for you...but for those of you that just watch movies like this for the \"porn value\" then you are out of luck.

These partisan, biased, and bigoted attitudes are not going to help anyone who really cares about making someone fall in love with them. I would never date anyone with these attitudes.

The upper classes, of course, saw nothing offensive in using demeaning terminology to describe inferior peoples, and for Wodehouse and his peers, Blacks were about as inferior as people got. In an unrelated short story (not in this volume) Wodehouse writes of an adventurous Englishwoman who would not marry a man she found enticing because he was \"black as the ace of spades.\" It was a laugh line whose humor depended on your acceptance that such an interracial union was absolutely beyond serious consideration.You can view this as offensive or just the way folks like Wodehouse saw things in 1936.

Easily the best CD of 2005, this one rocks with great authority and purpose. STEVEN WILSON proves yet again that his musical instincts are dead on. The guy oozes talent. He and his equallly talented bandmates have made a record rife with great riffs, melodic hooks, and long interludes of sonic splendor. The song ARRIVING SOMEWHERE BUT NOT HERE is an absolute epic that induces breathlessness. Every track on the record bristles with a ferocious, desperate electric current that shakes the spine. PORCUPINE TREE is simply the best rock band you've never heard of, and if you haven't, you're really missing out.

Characters come and go and the main character Hildy often does things, such as change sexes, that only seem like gimmicks. Many times he skips around to an overindulgent and annoying extent. I didn't find him overly sympathetic or interesting. However, It is interesting to think that people and even a supercomputer could become depressed as life becomes too easy as everything is taken care of down to morning breath.

Maude, who's first person narrative marks every other chapter, is a wonderful, realistic woman stuggling with money, her mother in law, and faith. Despite being in a completely different period of life, I really identified with Maude like I haven't with the too-sweet heroines of Christian romance. If you prefer plot-driven books then pass this by, it's not what you're looking for.

(In the first 10 minutes you throw about 500 punches, so adding 1 lb to each hand has a cumulative effect.)I had no problems with these at all, but I have larger hands. I could see how these might be a bit bulky on a woman with smaller hands.By the end of the workout they were pretty sweaty, so I'd reccomend using some disenfectant spray on them as well. But, despite the sweat the gloves stayed in place well, and your hands are free do do whatever you need to like grab a bottle of water etc.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: By-The-Numbers Load of Blech!\nText: This movie is nothing but a cliched creepfest whose laughable storyline consists of Richard Gere pining after some young girl.

The vocals are not your typical dreamy shoegazer style either; they are loud and obnoxious with a bunch of yeahs and heys. The British were definitely better at pulling off this style of music.

I usually prefer BBC productions of Christie's works, but this American version is a glowing exception (the BBC films drags slower than winter molasses, and none of the cast have the verve and energy of their American counterparts). Helen Hayes even attempts an English accent here and there, and even though she doesn't carry it off, her busybody Miss Marple is a delight, anyway (admirably supported by Barnard Hughes).

The second point is the cast. It was difficult to envisage Cuba Gooding Jr as the flamboyant character he plays as I always see him in goofy kid movies and it kind of watered down the believability factor. The same goes with Denzel Washington, although he is a classy actor with some great movies under him, I had a hard time picturing him as this ruthless character Lucas, kind of like Tom Hanks playing a hitman in Road To Perdition, you know he's a nice guy.

The fifth song will cause Wilco to tear their hair out and hire Jeff Lynne. Though his lyrics are lachrymose and morbid, they are so admittedly (\"this fascination with the moribund\"), and there's a great sense of fun in that. The only missteps here are one or two ballads (Shaken Baby is one), with gross jazzy chords tipping the mood into maudlin. Pernice can write this stuff in his sleep and it bogged down his Scud Mountain stuff, too.Thom Monihan's production is stellar, crisp and full throughout: Pernice's distinct vocals swoon atop layers of guitar, piano, organ, and strings.

I actually don't know much about Larkins but on this CD they complement each other very well and lay down some beautiful interpretations of these standards. Braff prefers the darker sound of the cornet (vs. trumpet) and Larkin's uncomplicated style provides a perfect river for Braff to navigate with interesting solos but ones that (fortunately) never stray too far from the original melody.

Good setting. And an intresting premise of stealing 50,000 dollars. It takes a while for the plot to build meticusesly, it really starts to pick up after you're two thirds into it, it starts to climax, and then nothing happens...it seems like Leonard just got bored with it and coped out.

The author captures, in a gentle way, the nuances of personal thoughts and human interaction.For me, there was only one weakness in this work. Ms. Laurie appears to have a misconception of men's feelings, particularly as they relate to women. On occasion, it appeared that one of the mechanisms the author uses to differentiate men from women is to have her male characters use vulgarity somewhat gratuitously. Although, in general, this work had less vulgarity than many others. Her representation of the inner thoughts of her male characters did not ring true, at least to this male reader.None-the-less, this is a marvelous work that holds your interest, leads you to care about, and feel you know, its main character Vinnie Miner, and is a hard book to put down.Highly recommended as an \"outstanding read\".

Practically the only song that has a good flow from eminem on encore is \"Mockingbird\". If this cd has flows like that with the same exact beats I would easily rate it with 4 stars. \"Mosh\" is clearly the best track, which has a good flow, good beat, and good focus. Other than that song it seems repetitive. His chorus' are weak and corny and last too long.

Norah's singing is even more spontaneous and open on these blues flavored tunes than on her own CDs. And while I admit I would not have purchased the album if not for Norah's involvement, I also enjoyed Mr. Malick's guitar playing. He can be subtle when the song calls for it (\"Strange Transmissions\") and then cut loose on something like the Stones-ish \"Things You Don't Have To Do.\"I thought Ms. Jones sounded a little like Janis Joplin before, but with this material the resemblance is even more noticeable. She has a true knack for the blues, and it's great to hear this slightly different side of her talents. If you're a fan of Norah's music, get this CD.

First off he burns the notes that could have been possible clues and he can't understand half the things that Anna is talking about. He just reminded me of a big dumb puppy dog. I think if she left out the part that Rein wasn't very smart this book would have been 5 stars since he would have turned out to be a charming hero I can't understand why she felt the need to make her character dumb.

Furthermore, after several seconds of pressing the shutter release and having it fail to focus, I'd lower the camera, only to have it focus on the floor and take a picture at that time.

For intermediate players this may be okay since it gives them the option of playing the melody in the lower octave.(2) Key for Mendelssohn's Wedding March was changed from the original C major to A-flat (4 flats). Not only is the key more difficult, it doesn't sound quite as good.(3) The violin/flute part for Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring only has the chorale melody.

I was also annoyed with the ending, and how many aspects of the storyline were not concluded very well or at all (hopefully the upcoming movie will do that better).However, as frustrating as it was to watch Nanny continually get the short end of the stick, and to not have a terribly satisfying ending, I still enjoyed this clever novel greatly!Grade: B+\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: Uninteresting.

The noise is captured on tape and is so loud it is hard to filter out without ruining the sound track.I purchased a Panasonic GS14 and while the CCD isn't as good as the JVC's, there is no motor noise at all.

Joseph Heller therefore proves the Catch-22 exists. but beyond this main point, I do not recognize any form of story developing. The whole story seemed to be going around in circles, and, if it wasnt for the humorous parts within the book every now and then, I may have put it down in utter confusion as to what was going on in the book.

But the director refused to go for the cheap effect (what tears there are, are genuine), thus turning this film into something maudlin. The trailer tells you misleadingly that this is a movie about a woman, her sister, and the man they both loved. I guess I missed that last part of the story (and thank God, the director did not dwell on the sensational element in the story). For me the film was about the relationship between two sisters, music, and death. The only criticism I do have is Ms Dupre's passion for music is not adequately covered; and in its place we get her dis-passion for her profession. Had the director confronted the passion aspect, he could have then woven the trilogy of concepts - human relationships, music, and death - into something awfully profound (but then again, perhaps this is something only Shakespeare could have pulled off). Still in this movie the beginning and end meet quite well.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Title: not what i expected.....\nText: I bought this book with the hope that it would detail the eating habits of those living in the paleolithic era.

It's made that job a lot easier; BUT, there are 2 flaws in my opinion: The scoop part is curved upward, so If you're trying to fling the poop elsewhere, it has a boomerang effect and can come right back at ya! (I throw it in a empty wooded lot I own, not a neighbor's yard ;))I also don't know why they didn't make the handle longer. I'm only 5'4\" tall; and between the short handle and oddly curved rake, I really have to crouch down to get the perfect angle so I can catch my prey. It really should not be that difficult. Just make a longer handle, with a straight rake and I'd be soooo happy! That's why I only gave this 4 out of 5 stars. I do recommend it over all other poop scoopers for grass though. It really speeds up the process.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Title: Medicore Continuations\nText: The story line continues to move slowly with sudden seemingly random jumps. Character development is either non-existant, or is accompished in three actions and moves people forward as if years have occured.I am still not a fan of the mixed style of Anime that is used for this story line. Using computer generated images for the 'Goddesses' while in combat brings memories of older video game movies that were not the best.Overall, the story and content are average, and the feeble attempts at hiding what is in store for the 'heroes' is not done as well as it could have been. This series straddles between trying to be the seriousness of Gasarki, and the silliness of older 'fighting robot' shows.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: What were these guys thinking?\nText: Nat Adderly & Frank Rosolino sound like they are playing brass kazoos!

One thing I couldn't understand: Lowell's character is portrayed as tough and independent, yet at times, she's whining that she doesn't get enough attention from ol' James.The biggest problem is Dalton. Like The Living Daylights (which is the worst Bond film ever), Dalton is dry, and displays none of the class, style, or sly humor which Connery, Moore, or even Brosnan have displayed.

His work is made of rocks, leaves, grass, ice, etc., that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field. Thus, most of Goldsworthy's works don't really last, except as photos or films of what they were. Now, one can argue that Goldsworthy's works are a reflection of mortality, or words to that effect, but isn't it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art. And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter, pretentious, often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings, Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite: a stable, unpretentious, family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in Scotland.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: For All Of You Kenny G Fans\nText: This man has been singing the same song for about 30 years now.

The murder took place in the last half of the book, and by that point you don't care about it.

And, her 'letter duet' with the Contessa will melt you into a puddle. I have seen 3 other versions of her role that don't come close. Furlanetto, as Figaro, is exceptionally fun to watch and hear.

He transports you back to early Soviet Russia in grainy black and white that makes you feel as you are watching a movie from that time frame. The actors are great, impeccably carrying out the famous roles that are dear to every Russian. Bulgakov created a literary classic in this tale about a doctor who transforms a dog into a man with darkly amusing consequences. Meanwhile, you see the soviet system closing in around Dr. Preobrazhensky, who has no time for it as he tries to keep his foul-mouthed new creation reined in. But, Poligraph Poligraphovich is as elusive as the mongrel he was created from and finally Dr. Preobrazhensky has no choice but to terminate his experiment. This is satire at its best, a film that is every bit as good as the novel. One can only hope that the film will be made available soon.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: another best seller for baldacci\nText: This has a different twist to the normal baldacci washington thrillers.

These brushes are all larger than I expected, the \"toothbrush\" is about 7.5\" long (for reference) and the smallest diameter brush is 7/16\" diameter, a little too big for many of the smaller orifices in most spray equipment.

He has shown that Buddhism is not some old, outdated religon based upon the esoteric writings of another culture and era, but it is alive today and ever-changing. \"Surfing the Himalayas\" does not conform to the standard image of Buddhism in many cases, but the standard image of Buddhism (like any religion) isn't necessarily the most accurate.

She is now just the ex presidents old lady - or she and clay will have to work it out - or stay broke up etc. Some of it was a bit too much and too bloody.

I believe that is his only qualification in that this book lacks any reason behind the statements. Soros makes blatant remarks about US and World institutions without ever providing an example to back it.

The end result is nothing more than a mish-mash of historical references and quips that are merely slung together in chronological order with no sense of purpose, and lacking any new insight or greater understanding of Walsingham's life or career.If you're looking for an interesting, in-depth narration of Walsingham's expansive service, this isn't it.

There are several humorous scenes that occur during training and at other times in the book that provide a laugh including the several scenes at Camp Pendleton.

Box weaves together environment and Wyoming history to tell his story. You will know who the villain is early on, but Box manages some good surprises nonetheless.The only quibble I have with the books is one I've seen elsewhere. Pickett is just a bit too self-effacing.

I actually purchased this sword to be ready when I started learning the nam dao techniques from my sifu, but when that time came, I ended up using a Katana instead because the nam do was just not good for training. It MAY be good for performance, so that if anyone wants to train for a show this could be a good sword.The s-shaped guard is loose, it shakes when the sword moves.

What I also really appreciate is the fact the movements are shown in both front and back view. This is great since the back view puts you in the same condition as in a class (back to the teacher) without haveing the mirror problem.

Abraham Lincoln supported a move to draft Confederate prisoners of war languishing (and often starving) in Northern prisons, with the stipulation that they would not have to go South and fight fellow Confederates. The \"Galvanized Yankees\" (so named because it was thought that their loyalty to the North was only a thin \"ganvanized\" layer) -- 6,000 of them, took the oath of loyalty to the Union and headed West to guard stagecoaches and mail routes. Numerous fights with Plains Indians, bitter cold, at lonely outposts were but a few of the hazards the Galvanized Yankees faced. My gg grandfather survived all this and returned home in 1866.

Nobody is entirely innocent in Martin Scorsese's remake of a film noir thriller from the 60s. This moral complexity and intense work from the talented cast, which includes Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis, make for an involving suspense film. A major drawback, though, is Scorsese himself, who indulges in some jarringly self-conscious effects and choppy pacing. These flaws become less apparent as the film builds momentum toward its powerful climax. Strangely, this film from one of our most talented directors features the most egregious example of product placement I have ever seen.

The dialogue between Holmes and Moran in THE EMPTY HOUSE is a faithful transcription of what Sir Arthur Conan Doyle actually wrote. The first three years of this series produced some outstanding episodes and THE EMPTY HOUSE is one of the best. It's beautifully directed and well written. Edward Hardwicke is excellent as the new Watson and Jeremy Brett is fascinating to watch, and even more fascinating to listen to. There is an amusing pastiche sequence at the start which takes place in the coroner's court. It nicely rounds out this story without padding it. The supporting players, particularly the excellent Colin Jeavons and Rosalie Williams, work well as an ensemble. You will want to watch this directly after viewing THE FINAL PROBLEM, another terrific episode; the two should really be sold as a set!\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: Warranty runs out, POP goes the drive\nText: It was a great deal when I bought it for my Mac as a backup drive for Time Machine.

Billed as the raunchiest film since Bad Santa, my expectations were high. As far as I'm concerned, the raunchier the better, but seldom is a film that calls itself raunchy, actually raunchy. Cameron Diaz was terrific, but the story was extremely weak. There is zero character development, I wanted to punch most of the supporting cast, and as far as being funny, it's only good for a snicker here and there. It's a predictable story about a gold digger seeking money to get plastic surgery. Parts of it are painful and the rest of it is just really stupid. Honestly, if it wasn't for the use of the F word, this movie would be rated PG-13 at best. Diaz is a fantastic actress and the story had so many possibilities, but they were all overlooked. The result, another mediocre, overrated, comedy billing itself as raunchy.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: Where's the variety?\nText: I'm wondering why everyone thus far has rated this book so highly.

Did the summer meeting need to drag on for the entirety? Or did we really need to go through 700 pages of her demonstrating fire over and over again?Maybe I'm being critical.

It's full of stereotypical Irish sayings which no-one in Ireland says (except to tourists) and for some reason the heroine starts to speak in Gaelic when she's all passionate..

This is an odd book because it doesnt lead you to any great conclusion. So in 10 years there will be twice as many Muslims as Christians, and 3 times as many hispanics as whites (not accurate to the book). Basically Buchanan uses numbers to generate fear in the reader. White christians are better than everyone else so instead of integrating with other cultures we should do everything possible to stop these other cultures from having numerical dominance. The book leaves the reader wondering, where has buchanan been for the past 3o years? The book also leaves the reader wondering what action we should take. Should we nuke the muslims? castrate the catalonians? The only good point Buchanan makes is that immigrants are not \"americanized\" like they used to be.

Lars sounds horrible on the drums (maybe it was just the horrible production) and Kirk does not solo. This album sounds more like Linkin Park and Lim Biskit (bands I loathe) than Metallica.With that in mind, I'm glad I only borrowed the cd from a friend and didn't buy it myself.

It's a very clever format, using Dunbar's words and experience to portray life on the ass-edge of the UK.\"The Arbor\" is often hard to watch, and I admire it for the unflinching grit portrayed by actors and director.

Looking back from the perspective of 75 years, Prohaska sardonically tells of the boredom of duty in the prewar Austrian navy, the absurdities of the Hapsburg court and the multinational, multilingual Hapsburg government, and the vicious twists and turns of Balkan politics. The novel culminates with a Keystone Kops execution scene that is almost as hilarious as the one in The Two-Headed Eagle, a scene that sums up the sense of existential futility with which suffuses The Emperor's Coloured Coat.

I guess the most major is language. The dialect of the boys, although entertaining, overshadows the story itself to some point, and is little more than a device to smooth over some of the rougher areas of the literature. Despite that, it was a good, even touching story despite the raw violence that seemed to jump off of every page. Yet despite their raping and beating and killing you manage to feel some compassion for the boys. I won't give away the ending, but in a mark of true fiction, you find the signs of a character who is dynamic both inside an dout in Alex, the leader of the boys. I think it is a good book because it takes a satrical look at the side of society that is too often ignored, although perhaps not so much satrical as just a magnified projection.

I even got a different sharpening stone than what was included with the set and gave that a try. no luck. the entire piece felt loosely contructed, as though it would fall apart if I wasn't careful.I did, however, get a couple of knives for Christmas. I got an OXO good grips chef's knife and two wusthoffs. I found these knives to be far superior and although I know that they are expensive, but they are exceptional.

I felt Thinner was just too slow and it's the first book I have ever actually skimmed through at times. The last 75 pages or so made up for the slow parts but the book is only 318 pages to begin with.For those who do not know, the book is centered around a gypsy curse which is placed on the man that kills the gypsy's daughter. The man sees the gypsy outside the courthouse and the gypsy whispers thinner as he caresses the mans cheek. Mr. Halleck loses a very large amount of weight-around 120lbs. Everyone, including family, thinks he is losing his mind when he mentiones the curse. Therefore Mr. Halleck must search for the gypsy to try and reverse the curse.

Turning down shadows, cars, etc can help, but what's the fun in that??While the game and it's graphics and features are great, this is definitely another prime example of EA releasing a game before it's ready, and your game play will suffer because of it.

This trip, however, turned out to be quite a disappointment. Mr A-Z is completely different from the mellow, mainly acoustic stylings of Jason and encompasses many genres which Jason just doesn't work with. His voice is still amazing, and a few of the songs are highly addictive (ie.

In this novel, there is apparently, censorship in the society. Even though you may think that this book is nothing like reality, it really is. We censor things like their community does. We don't want our nation to see certain things and neither does the community in The Giver. This censorship may be for better, possibly for the worse.

Beyond all the \"gimmicks\" there is a solid, mostly true heartwrenching story about real people. Dave does a great job at creating an emotional honesty and truth in the characters. Editing the truth, or more accurately, not editing the truth is a tough job in a memoir and I think he succeeds admirably.

Police Detective John Rebus is a rounded human character, and Edinburgh makes a colorful backdrop to his stories, which are generally well plotted. However, \"In Black and Blue,\" Rankin was just a little too ambitious. There are enough plots and subplots for five books, and he isn't always deft at juggling them. I often found myself scratching my head and flipping back pages to remember who a particular character was (there are a dozen major police characters alone). This is a major distraction in a mystery novel, which should be read full steam ahead. The plot strands involve gangsters, drug dealers, rogue cops, the oil trade, and two (count them two) serial killers. The denouement of all this is far from satisfying: the strands don't come together as neatly as a reader would have wished.I'm still high on Rankin, but I wish he had turned this one into two separate novels (perhaps \"Black\" and \"Blue\").\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Title: Speakers\nText: I bought them to go with a new television and they would not hook up to it so I sent them back.

Although Granados and De Falla are fairly easy to find on disc the same cannot be said for the other composers most of whom are usually represented only by guitar or piano music. The only problem with this CD, and one which for many will spoil the recital, is the decision of Herald (a small UK independant) to omit texts and translations. Some of the songs, such as Espla's Pregon - a collection of street vendor cries, or Mompou's Combat del somni - based on a Catalan poem, and others, are difficult to follow without texts, and Campos' sensitive treatment of the words is lost. The notes are over brief and in English only.

I'm no Bronte scholar, but the style didn't particularly remind me of Bronte (and I've read all of her novels, some multiple times), and the subject matter was far more overtly feminist than Bronte ever allowed herself to be.The novel traces the lives of four women - Sarah (the \"Miss Miles\" of the title), Maria, Dora, and Amelia - focusing particularly on their efforts to gain economic independence and thus on women's role in society. Perhaps fewer heroines would have improved the plot, as it was a little confusing to be constantly switching viewpoints and plot threads.

The story functions as a vision quest. A young girl in American suburbia with a bouffant mother, an assinine (and threatening) stepfather, tries to use her art to reconstruct and resurrect her lost and damned sculptor father, and doing so, finds herself. The surreal symbolism is effective with its many references to the underwater world, mating walruses, sharks, drowning.

This book recounts his climb of Nanga Parbat in 1970 with his brother Gunther and a team formed by Dr. Karl Maria Herligkoffer. It is really Messner's explanation of the events that led to Gunther's death on the mountain, illumintated by his grief over the loss of his beloved brother. Of course the disputes over these events will never be resolved, many of the participants are now dead, but Naked Mountain is an act of contrition and catharsis for Messner more that a readable tale of adventure.

These are not things that you must convince OTHERS to do. These are tools to help you poison less and heal more.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: Mr. Who? Certainly not COFFEE!\nText: We had high hopes for our new Mr. Coffee with the thermal carafe. The first pot we made was lukewarm at best and we were disappointed.

I really hated the filling guide on the front of the carafe, too. Very hard to see when the maker is full and all too often, the water is running all over the counter from a little hole in the back of the maker.

Maybe it was because he looked like an intergalactic Al Bundy or even a skinhead Tom Baker.

He's more believable than his predecessor, and his portrayal of our favourite Time Lord is the best I've seen in quite some time. Series 2 has preserved the spirit of classic DW while taking a bold step into the future (no pun intended), andstory arcs like 'Rise of the Cybermen'/'Age of Steel' and the season finale will not disappoint. 'The Idiot's Lantern' could've been from season 24-26.'School Reunion' and 'Tooth and Claw' are also excellent. Simply put, there is not one single story I didn't like.

Many, like Miller, refused to testify, but many others did name names which created a spiritual schism in the ranks of playwrights and screenwriters of that era which lingered for many years and ruined many careers.

I'll be the first to admit that the conception of the book was undoubtedly clever, and must have taken a good bit of work. But just as it's not possible to make a cake without decent ingredients and it *is* possible to make a horrid cake despite the best ingredients, The Knot Garden turns to compost in this author's hands. The book is a mystery, yet as we near the end of the book, there is no mystery left to solve, and along the way, no Aha! moment. One needn't be clever to figure the thing out-- once the clues are in place, a six year old could untie this unsavory glop. And ultimately, with everything and everyone revealed, there is an overwhelming sense of \"So what?\" for the reader to take home.

Barth is clearly having fun with the reader as much as he is with his characters. And his constants, of course--the Mid-Atlantic, college and academia, the middle class, the Cold War, etc.More of a lit theory companion piece than anything else, Where Three Roads Meet has the author in command of a genre he himself has more or less created.

But. . . for the pastor or preacher that is wanting to discover a method for communicating God's timeless truths and making them relevant and applicable in today's society - this book is worth the effort. I found that I had to re-read some sections and work at it so as not to fall back into old habits. I would suggest trying to read it while on a vacation, holiday or sabbatical and then taking some time to try and implement the methods described.

On these pages we read Truman's uncensored opinions on MacArthur, Ike, Marshall and generals in general, Dean Atcheson, Richard Nixon, the presidency and a host of other topics. Here we learn his conviction that the U.

But it does have its moments and it is not to be ignored.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Title: BEST GAME IN THE WORLD\nText: Ever since the game was made, I have been addicted to it.

Rewards rereading, too!\nText: While I'm usually a skeptic of fantasy as a genre, and doubly so of vampire/werewolf fiction, I find this book surprisingly delightful. My first read of the ARC gave me hints of depth and metaphor that stretch far beyond what I normally expect of a first time author, and required a second reading. Rarely do books of this genre offer more than a stage for the sexual fantasies of socially stunted teens this one, however, offers metaphoric discourse on race, prejudice, homosexuality, HIV/AIDS, and gender issues. Yet, unlike most books that strive woodenly for a social relevance, this book also offers a very solid story that holds the reader from cover to cover. The book is unusually short for a modern fantasy offering, (which is in itself quite refreshing) and the author goes straight to the story without a lot of self-indulgent fluff that seems to be the earmark of most current urban fantasy novels. Overall, I highly recommend this book.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: Lego Star Wars Set\nText: Grandson loved it. In fact, both grandsons love Lego Star War figures.

The addition of heroes is nice, but (game balance issues aside) isn't enough to make this game feel new and different.If anything, I found WC3 to be a step in the wrong direction. The single-player campaign is so highly scripted it feels like a Sierra game, where every two minutes the computer takes control away from you and you have sit and watch another cut scene. The maps are very restrictive, with narrow pathways (you can't walk through wooded areas) channeling you down one or two directions in every level. This left me feeling claustrophobic.The levels make the game feel more like an old 1D side-scroller than a modern, open-ended \"3D\" game. The combination of heavy scripting and tightly constrained levels means there is zero replay value in the single player campaign.If you want a RTS that really has a new and different feel, try Kohan Immortal Soverigns and Kohan Ahriman's Gift.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Title: Finally, a new and original twist to the fantasy genre. . .\nText: THE MAGIC OF RECLUCE brings a whole new approach to the magic contained in typical fantasy novels. The magic in this novel is divided into three catagories: white is chaos, black is order, and grey is both. Mr. Modesitt goes into great length describing the rules of these magics, and one of the most interesting ideas that he presents is that order and chaos cannot exist without one another. Mr. Modesitt also presents a large stock of characters with whom it is easy to relate, especially to the main character because the first person narraration allows us to know what he is thinking and identify with him.

He says independent thinking about our work, relationships and values will guide our life, and thus enhance our self-esteem.

Besides the admitted stupidity of having Riker pilot the Enterprise with a joy stick, and Data removing an emotion chip that had been fused into his Neural net, the basic story has the depth that the better Next Generation episodes had. Picard shows the kind of moral leadership that we all crave from our leaders. Patrick Stewart is so convincing. His focus is so intense.

The author really should have considered the fact that most readers are not MIND-readers and could not possibly decipher the hidden meanings behind some of the passages.

Don't expect a page-turner here.While I won't recommend this book, as a first effort from the authors it is not that bad. What is sad, though, is that this website was salted with positive reviews, probably from friends. Maybe this is the hidden play in the playbook, taken from Microsoft's PR department, meant to make a second-rate product look good. They impugn book the book and the site.Summary: First, don't judge this book by online reviews. Second, wait for the 2nd edition.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: Disappointed in Dulli\nText: In a word: Boring.

The uplift concept is conveniently explained here, where it isn't in SR. Even when the dialog is at its tackiest (and for SF, it's low in tacky dialog), there is a legitimate reason for it...at least I think so. A fun read.

With \"The Breed\" he does bring out some scary options for the typical characters he has. In this movie they are of course just a bunch of college students on some vacation getaway on an island that formerly housed some secret government test facility that experimented with dogs.It has the usual problem presented which has the youths trying to figure out a plan of escape as well as at times, a plan of attack. In the end I just felt like this movie was sub standard slash that did not have enough staying power to make me feel like it had any value to be viewed again. Craven needs to concentrate on getting more intricate scripts that are followed up by some better actors, but that costs more money so I am not expecting anything spectacular from him anytime soon.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: Hangs close to the subject\nText: I also teach a Rock History class and use this as an overview.

The footage of Fabian singing near the end is the best I have seen for explaining a Teen Idol, and Pat Boone gets the drubbing he deserves. John Heard is the narrator, which is cool.This is good for what it sets out to do: to reinforce the rhythm and blues origins of this music and the arrogance and malice of the musical powers of the day such as Steve Allen and Ed Sullivan.

True, it's essentially a rip off of Stephen Chow's Shaolin Soccer with a basketball theme, and not as well done, but it was entertaining. That being said, it did have several slow parts, and some rather cheesy plot points, not to mention very overt deus ex machina type resolutions, but nontheless it was entertaining. Worth a watch if you have the time and nothing better to do.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: did not fit\nText: This did not fit my 10 foot pool. I maybe could have really stretched it with the someones help. Disappointed that I could not return it.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: Put that Dog Turd Down ! Don't even think about it.\nText: I have seen many bad movies and have liked some of those, but this is in a league of it's own.There should be a real hard beating given to the makers of this movie and I for one would change my name if I were in this flick.I paid $3.00 for it at the Mexican swap and shop and the illegal that sold it to me is feeling pretty bad about now knowing it was $2.99 to much. You will be better off slamming your hand in the car door then trying to set thru this one. Story: what story ?Acting: some of the worst I have ever seen. Direction: NoneVisuals: Ha Ha.Forget this movie was every made, wish I could.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Title: 2 days old and BROKEN\nText: These might be nice headphones, can't really tell, THEY ARE BROKEN. there is a little dainty stirrup shaped brittle plastic piece that holds the \"reversible\" earpiece to the headband. This piece is not sturdy enough for adults and I'm sure children would snap this earpiece/earphone off. It is under pressure when the headphones are worn, and this is the weakest link when it should be the sturdiest! I am tired of repairing headphones, I would not advise these headphones to anyone who wanted to use them more than a couple days.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: Motor noise problem\nText: I bought this camera thinking it was a great valu for the price, but when you record anything (interior and exterior) you are recording all the motor noise from the camera's mechanical system.I try to reduce the noise by editing, with pinnacle, and that work if nobody is speaking.The image quality is good, the camera look great and is tiny, you can carry it very easy.I don't recommend this camcorder, spend a few bucks more and get another brand\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Title: The miles fly by!\nText: There are lots of miles of roads in AK, and driving them can be a bit boring. Unless you have the milepost to guide you. There are interesting things happening all along the roadside, and a long road trip will whiz by when you are aware of what you are seeing, or can anticipate what is coming up around the bend.Well worth the investment.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Title: 2.5 stars out of 4\nText: The Bottom Line:Though if you're a fan of Hitchcock you might be interested to see what he does with a real life version of his \"wrongfully accused man\" chestnut, The Wrong Man is just not that good a movie: relying on a true story means that not a lot happens and the things that do, like Vera Miles' breakdown, don't really work.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: Good watch....lousy lap/start button\nText: good functionality except for start/lap button. Big hassle if you're doing laps/repeats in the pool. You've either got to slam the button, or nearly stop your training and push the button hard. The audible beep is barely audible so you end up pushing the button several times...which gives you a few laps of 0.2 or 0.1 seconds. Hard to get a good average lap time when you throw in some extreme low values like 0.1 and 0.2.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Title: Below average\nText: some of the production is good most of it is pretty dull and trite. Her singing? Non existent...its more electronica than a musician slash vocalist - britney will sell becuaseh er image selss simple - why even bother argueing those merits...she has a a whole brigade of brainwashed kids who want to worship someone and they have found a willing idol. On average its better than her first three albums - however thats not saying much there is no breakaway single in this set. The best song is toxic and its not that great - its an average track -----I listened to all the tracks and was not smitten with a single track - I suggest Outkast - now that album I instanteously loved - an album shouldnt HAVE TO grow on you - but even then In the zone wont hold you for that long - GET OUTKAST!!!!!!!! that album is eclectic and amzing!\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Title: Sony Wireless Headphones\nText: Good product. Be careful about static electricity though, as I shorted out my first wireless headset when placing it back in the charging unit.\n"}]

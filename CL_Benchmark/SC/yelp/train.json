The chicken was a tad dry and came across as leftover rotisserie chicken from Safeway tossed with peppers, asparagus and rosemary and then left on top of potatoes.

Most of my reviews consist of me bragging about how unrealistically hot I am, how even my cheapest article of clothes costs thousands of dollars, how awesome my hair looks, and how your personal opinions are WRONG and my opinions are Scientific Facts. If I were a Buddhist, I would chose to be reincarnated as myself. Though it is true that I have too much money to spend and an extremely high opinion of myself, what I am practically trying to do is exactly what the \\\"heel character\\\"(aka the bad guy) does at the Pro-Wrestling shows. I talk sh!t on every onlooker until they can't stand it anymore and send me tons of death threats, insults, and angry messages. Sometimes I wonder if I have Oppositional Defiant Disorder, because I seem to get high on annoying and pissing people off.  But, I promise that this will be my last Schtick review.....maybe..\\n\\nNow on to the review....\\n\\nPeople in Las Vegas are pretty stupid, but people in NW Las Vegas are even worse. Las Vegas is like DUMB and NW Vegas is like DUMBER. So practically what we got here is a city full of Harrys and Lloyds. So, I can understand why some people would give this place a low-rating because they don't have the intelligence, class, and sophistication(Like I have) to enjoy such a fine bowl of Vietnamese Pho.\\n\\nThe Pho itself is extremely oily. This is natural! You really want to see oil rise to the top of soups like Pho and Tonkatsu Ramen. Why? Because that is the first visual indication that the broth is made from boiling bones for over 16+ hours.  If the soup has no oils rise to the top, it means that either the bones were not boiled long enough or they used a powder mix to make the broth.  The only times I ever see anything more greasy and oily than Natural Pho is when I have to look at the profile pictures of the Elite Yelper's faces(Of course not counting the Elites who are on my friends list, who are all like extremely hot like myself).\\n\\nThe Steak they use at PHO ROSE is very tender, soft, and lean. I think they might be using sirloin.  Just a note: I know that most of you NW Vegas residents live paycheck-to-paycheck. I know most you guys barely make enough money to pay the bills. I also know that you are used to eating Grade F Low Quality beef from Walmart. But, Sophisticated(like me), wealthy(like me), and Upper-Class people(like me), eat nothing but Organic Sirloin and Filet everyday. So unlike you guys, I know a good piece of steak when I see one. And, PHO ROSE has some good quality meat. \\n\\nOkay...the portions here are not as big as the places on Spring Mountain. But, the prices are a bit lower. Also, lets factor in the convenience of not having to drive 30 minutes in bad traffic to Spring Mountain and Valley View.  You know, if you have to complain about a $7.50 bowl of Pho being too expensive then you shouldn't be eating out at all. You should be saving your welfare checks to pay rent at your weekly-rate roach infested apartments.  So maybe next time, don't blow your paycheck on your gambling addiction, and don't spend so much money getting drunk and stupid at bars...... and maybe you won't have to complain about $7.00 being \\\"too expensive\\\". \\n\\nOkay... I noticed my Yelp Friend Mike C gave this place a 1-star review. I respect his review. I noticed he last ate here in 2010. I think he should give this place another try because I think they have made a lot of changes.\\n\\nSo, I would eat here again on account of the food, service, and convenience.  The only thing that might keep me away is the fact that this place is located near Summerlin. I don't know why, but every time I come back to Summerlin, the people just keep getting uglier!

And they had both hot and cold to select from.  I tried both.  Both were very dry and little on the meat.  The legs are cut length wise down the middle, so you get one really thin side of meat to eat, which takes a lot of work to get a small dry and flaky reward.  They have several stations to sample different parts of styles; Asian, Mediterranean, American, Mexican and a couple others.  The Asian sucked.  Noodles were bland and the Korean ribs fat and greasy.  The Prime rib (which was actually Ribeye roast, not Prime) was dark throughout.  There is a cold cut section which was tasty, but all the cheeses next to it were cubed.  So if you wanted to make a little sandwich, you were out of luck.  I tried a pepperoni pizza bagel and waited until a fresh one came out of the oven.  When I got back to my table to eat, it was soggy in the middle, disgusting.

The wait was still going to be 25-30 minutes. In the parking lot you do have to park and walk into the restaurant.

The only difference here is that they speak very good English and they don''t call their customers \\\"Master\\\".   Since this is their soft opening, all their menu items were 25% off.  What a sweet deal considering how expensive Japanese food could be.  But actually their menu items are reasonably priced.

The gyoza was quite tasty, but I must say that these were the smallest gyoza I have ever had.  The karaage chicken wings came with ketchup and Japanese mayonnaise dip.  It was good, but probably would not order this again because it is deep fried.  I had the miso ramen.  The presentation of the ramen bowl was very pretty and just like the ones you get in Japan.  The miso broth though could have been more concentrated, but not bad.  My wife had the tonkotsu ramen and she really enjoyed it.  The broth was excellent and the egg, sliced roasted pork and other condiments complemented each other very well.  The roasted pork slices in the ramen could have been sliced a little more thicker.

I've eaten at every major Ramen-Ya on the West coast, so I got a lot of credibility when it comes to recognizing a good bowl of Ramen. So my assessment is that: SHOKU RAMEN-YA doesn't have a good bowl of Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen...SHOKU has a GREAT bowl of Hakata Tonkotsu. \\n\\nThings have changed a lot here in the last month. I came here over a month ago during their soft opening,  and the manager was still training the cooks and servers to be more proficient. Today when I came to SHOKU, everything had been perfected. I have to congratulate the new manager(Ehren) for working non-stop around the clock, and dedicating his whole life into turning this place into one of the best Ramen-Yas in Las Vegas. The flavor of the Hakata Tonkotsu was a world of difference from last month! You can really taste the pork bones and marrow from them preparing the broth all day long in that traditional Kyushu style. \\n\\nThe Charsu has changed as well. It's very soft, fatty, and tender like the ones you get at Onizuka Street. I loved it! \\n\\nUnlike 99% of the Ramen-Yas in LV, SHOKU actually has a Hanjuku Egg as one of their add ons. This is big! This really BIG!  Monta, Sora, and Shuseki only have normal medium-boiled eggs. A Hanjuku egg needs a lot of work to prepare correctly. It needs to be boiled for exactly 7 minutes to preserve it's extremely runny nature, then it must be instantly placed into ice water or the egg will continue to cook itself and the yolk will be ruined.Afterwards it's transferred to a mixture of shoyu, sugar, and sometimes vinegar. It will then be marinated for many hours. SHOKU is the only Ramen-Ya in Vegas that features this style of egg. It's a very rare delicacy here in LV. \\n\\nThe Bacon Fried rice was the best Japanese fried rice I have ever had. Better than Monta...Better than Yagyu Yakinku..Better than Shuseki. The Bacon Rice here at SHOKU RAMEN-YA is a perfect fusion blend of flavors. It has the buttery qualities of Hibachi Fried Rice(ex-Benihana), but with much stronger and unique added flavors. Because SHOKU is a Bachi Burger spinoff, their cooks do fusion better than anyone. \\n\\nThe manager of this restaurant told me that in a few weeks they will add Tan Tan Men onto the menu. I was like HOLY SH!T THIS IS HEAVY! Every Yelper knows that Tan Tan Men is my favorite Ramen variation in the world. I've been to every major Ramen-ya on the westcoast and only like 8 of them had Tan Tan Men. For those who don't know, Tan Tan Men is a very difficult dish to master for any chef. That's why there are Ramen-Yas that specifically specialized in ONLY Tan Tan Men. I've been to Chinese-Japanese Ramen houses where TTM was the only thing on the menu because the chef needed to put all his attention in only that one thing. I can't wait to see the SHOKU variation of Tan Tan Men. Ehren is one of the most talented restaurant managers in Las Vegas, and I'm confident that his staff can master this difficult variation. \\n\\nI encourage all the Nisei, Sansei, and Yonsei to come eat here, especially if you are from Hawaii. Every Japanese born in Hawaii I have spoken to have told me that SHOKU is one of the best Ramen-Yas on the mainland. There is something about the flavors here at SHOKU that make Hawaiians happy. I know that many of my Japanese-Hawaiian Yelp friends would love this place. \\n\\nAlso, remember that this is a Kyushu style Ramen-Ya so it would be a travesty to order something that wasn't Tonkotsu. You don't go to a Sapporo Ramen house and not order the Miso. You don't got to a Tokyo Ramen house and not order the Shoyu. You don't go to a Chinese-Japanese Ramen house and not order the Tan Tan Men. And you defiantly should not go to a Hakata Ramen-Ya and not get the Tonkotsu. Tonkotsu is the signature dish of Hakata, Kyushu.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Text: I love the firehouse theme, and like how the restaurant pays tribute to firefighters.

Now I know that there are a good number of bad reviews and alot of them are about Steve who supposedly babbles on and on and constantly coughs into the microphone for the entire 50 minute ride to the dam. Well I can now confirm for you that this is true.\\n\\nI found a deal on Groupon where the tickets were half price. with that being said I paid $29 each ticket. At first I was unsure weather to make the purchase, but despite the negative reviews I read about this tour company I figured I would be on vacation so why not. Best case it would be an great tour and worst case it would be a memorable experience. I think that because I went with an open mind this set the stage for my experience. \\n\\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\\nBefore arriving in Vegas I called the tour company, gave them my groupon purchase confirmation and reserved the date. The phone operator instructed me to go to the west wing at the MGM grand (where we were staying) where they would pick us up for our tour. The phone operator was helpful, friendly, and accommodating and helped to plan our tour.\\nTOUR DAY! Fast forward to the morning of the tour. We made our way to the west wing at the MGM as instructed and were somewhat confused to if we going the right way as the MGM is a very large hotel. (asking for directions from hotel staff is advised). We made our way to the west wing tour lobby. We walked out the door (still confused if we were in the right area) and a guy asks if we were going to a tour. I respond yes (expecting the guy to be some kind of promoter trying to sell me something like everyone else in Vegas) but to my surprise he pulled out his list and greeted me by name and then pointed over and said \\\"That's the dam bus, we will be leaving shortly\\\". Our pickup driver was great! very personable and had a great sense of humor. Overall It was a good start and certainly set the stage of what to expect.\\nREGISTRATION:\\nAfter being picked up from our hotel, we stopped at a couple other hotels before being dropped off at registration at the miracle mile shops where we signed in, picked up our name badge, and were assigned a bus. \\nTHE TOUR:\\nWe were assigned to \\\"Bus1\\\" and immediately upon climbing into the coach I saw the driver's name tag on the driver's shirt that read \\\"Steve\\\". Based on the reviews I have read online, my initial reaction was \\\"Oh god, Here we go\\\" So we climbed on to the bus. The driver, Steve, closed the door, stood up in the isle way and over the microphone started to instruct everyone on what not to do and how we should keep our voices down while he was talking over the microphone. He then began to start talking about the bus and how old and elaborated about how bad it was (the bus was average, it had AC and was clean). So with that interesting start, we began our 50 minute trip from the las vegas strip to Hoover dam. Steve talked continuously and he did not pause between his sentences for the entire 50 Minute ride there. Steve loved to ramble about random topics and would then ask rhetorical questions such as \\\"Well Steve, how did that happen\\\" to which he would answer himself with an even longer explanation. The best part is that Steve spent our entire 50 Minute ride to the dam hacking and coughing mid sentence. He literally never stops talking and maybe that is why he is always clearing his throat as other reviews suggest. Either way it was hilarious. Once we got to the dam, we offloaded and were given 2.5 hours to do the tour and wander the dam, I was interested in taking the power plant tour however the lines inside the dam tour were ridiculous (Run by a different company, please read my hoover dam review for more information) after waiting in line for over an hour we decided to cut our losses where we went back outside, walked the dam, did the tourist thing and grabbed lunch at the dam cafe before heading back to the bus. we took another bus ride this time for about 40 minutes where we stopped at a chocolate and going to our hotel. \\n\\nSteve our driver, while he talked non-stop, was loaded with information about vegas history. You can ask him questions and he will tell you a story, and he has a wicked sense of humor that kept me laughing almost the entire ride.  \\n\\nCLOSING:\\nSimply put, if you have a planned agenda, high expectations, like to be in control, are hung over, or are an overall boring person, then I'd suggest you not be on bus1.\\nIf you are adventurous, whimsical, and have fun with whatever comes along then I highly recommend you take Steve's tour bus as it is hilarious.\\n\\nAs for myself, I know that I will have to take this tour again the next time I am in vegas.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Text: I might be able to give this place another try.

The next time I got \\\"no carb fried chicken\\\" which is just fried chicken without breading, and I will say that this made me rethink fried chicken completely.

We'd tried to go there a couple years ago, but the crowd outside was always too threatening a wait. Then, in August, we tried to go, but when we asked \\\"What's the probable wait time?\\\" We were told, \\\"Oh we don't really provide anyone with wait times.\\\" The line outside was pretty long, and there wasn't really any shade, and with no potential end to the wait, we came to terms with the possibility that we'd turn into bacon ourselves sitting outside waiting for a table. \\n\\nThen this morning I woke up at 6:30am on a Saturday due to insomnia and we said \\\"Hey there might actually not be a line if we go right now.\\\"\\n\\nI just came back from breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast and now I'm waiting for my heart attack.\\n\\nI'd tried to find out what the big deal was about this greasy spoon so many times in reviews, and nobody ever gave a good explanation in detail of what makes the \\\"traditional breakfast food\\\" so \\\"different.\\\"\\n\\nI ordered the special - which was an egg, cheese, onion and sausage omelette, with hash browns. Since it was our first time there, we also ordered a belgian waffle to split.\\n\\nThe omelette was more like \\\"Onion and Sausage with a side of egg and cheese.\\\" The sausage was giant sliced links, enough to feed an army. The amount of onion was not what I expected - it was probably two entire onions sliced up and thrown in there. The hash browns are a serving for 4 people or something. They're not sliced like ordinary hash browns are sliced - they're ultra skinny slices like angelhair pasta. There are a lot of really crunchy crispy areas of angelhair sliced hash browns which are tasty. Thankfully, they are not all salty. But what sort of human can ingest this much potato in one sitting?\\n\\nI'm one year away from having been a vegetarian for 5 years, and I was willing to \\\"go there\\\" at this meal because I had to see what everyone was raving about, and I read on the menu that the meat is natural and grain-fed. Not free-range, grass-fed, but at least not corn-fed and hormonalized and antibiotic-ridden. Also, I eat burgers at Delux and Rokerij and I'll eat the prosciutto at Bomberos. So I thought, why not see what the fuss is all about?\\n\\nIt was a'ight. Not FABULOUS. I tried to figure out why this place is SUCH a big deal to so many. Maybe it is shocking to some people's palates to taste food made with real butter and real cream - people who ordinarily cook at home and fill their cupboards with the healthy substitutes of every ingredient. Or maybe typical people buy Kraft cheese or something, I don't know. The ingredients were definitely \\\"real,\\\" which is, I suppose, a big deal if you ordinarily eat Crap for breakfast or eat at Denny's. It most definitely beats \\\"Moons Over My Hammy\\\" for instance.\\n\\nBut we really missed Pallate, which really WAS the best breakfast downtown.\\n\\nThe bread they brought for the toast was delicious ... but it's BREAD. Most bread is pretty good. The waffle was uber fluffy. I had a few bites and said \\\"That's a tasty plate of diabetes right there,\\\" while I felt my blood sugar go through the roof.\\n\\nMostly, I really felt a lack in the vegetables department. \\n\\nI might seem like a health nut, because of this, but trust me, I'm not. I'm a tall, big person and I eat breakfasts at Dick's Hideaway several times a week. It's just that at Dick's Hideaway I can have them substitute the potatoes for veggies (usually asparagus and broccoli), and substitute the meat in the breakfast burrito with avocado. I'm used to having an entire day's worth of greens at breakfast. I suppose meat, for me, is like dessert: I'll eat it but it has to be high quality, and it has to be really worth it. It has to be tremendously delicious, I won't eat meat for meat's sake. This was probably somewhat ethical meat, but it wasn't an irresistible herby or spicy delicious sensation.\\n\\nThe \\\"thick-cut bacon\\\" that came with the waffle was definitely thick, and was lined with pepper.

They were AMAZING!!!  So fresh (even though it was the end of the day), soft, great flavor, solid quality.  \\n\\nThey are not \\\"cakey\\\" in terms of texture...more so light and fluffy.  They use local ingredients and they switch up the flavors daily.  They have flavors with coconut, bacon, banana, chocolate, etc.  So good.  They also serve coffee and have a few tables in case you choose to dine-in.  \\n\\nWe were told that 4 donuts is $14 but 6 donuts is $15.  So, you do the math.  1/2 a dozen is the way to go and don't act like you can't figure out what to do with that many donuts.  Call me and I will help you out if needed.\\n\\nLove that they are on Monroe Road---we need more things on the East Side/Matthews.  They are open daily from 7am-3pm except on Monday's.  They sell out fast is what we were told so get there early for the best and freshest options!!  I can't wait to return.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Text: I like Caesars a lot.

Imagine my surprise to discover it was under new management (I should have read the recent reviews first). I was a fan of Kampai because it was possibly the most authentic Japanese restaurant in Phoenix.\\n\\nThe decor hasn't changed (which, frankly, could use some refreshing, like the seat cushions in the booths are sagging, but overall, is still quite serviceable and even charming), but the menu has changed radically and now includes an almost encyclopedic collection of \\\"maki\\\" sushi (sushi rolls), most of which seem be to calculated to appeal to western tastes. Think Philly and California rolls (along with Caterpillar rolls, Arizona rolls, etc.). Yes, you can still get sushi by the piece, but not sure if I'd bother, they didn't even have tamago (egg omelet) and the surf clam (both nigiri) we had fell apart. Perhaps they should stick with chirashizushi instead of nigiri. I also didn't think the sushi rice was well prepared or that the fish was properly chilled (it seemed a tad warm). I was not impressed.\\n\\nAlong with the sushi we also had a cucumber and seaweed salad (actually, sunomono) which was surprisingly good.\\n\\nCompliments, however, to the wait staff as they were exceedingly attentive and food and drinks were served with a smile and promptly. The staff is probably what stopped me from leaving too quickly (the staff under previous management was always warm and welcoming and I miss them).\\n\\nNow for the food coming out of the kitchen: Another delightful surprise, it was well executed. It was obvious to me that the tempura recipe was slightly different than previously, but it was well done and not greasy. A few details were off-putting, though, there was no gobo root in the vegetable mix and far too many slices of potato, and this time, pieces of chicken, too, which were a little stringy, I'd rather have had an additional shrimp (the large prawns were cut in half lengthwise and served in individually making the serving seem more generous than it was).\\n\\nAlso since the new management, the prices have risen rather steeply: Una-ju (eel over rice) is up sharply and several other items went up as well. Given recent economic times and the rise in restaurant prices, I'm not sure this is entirely fair, but some of the prices went up rather surprisingly high. It is easy, with drinks, to run to over $30.00 per person.\\n\\nThe new restaurant menu is all over the place: It appears that the new owners have tried to keep the core menu, but other additions make it seem disorganized, as if they are trying to please too many. The new menu has Fried rice, bulgogki, tempura, nabeyaki. Fried rice? And, yes, something like an encyclopedia of sushi rolls (2 pages worth).\\n\\nI went to Kampai because it reminded me of restaurants when I was in Japan. It was not striving for fusion or pan-Asain cuisine, or tons of novelty - a new dish now and then, fine, but was a solid example of quietly typical Japanese cuisine; quality classic food and an intimate atmosphere rather than catering to western ideas of what sushi and Japanese food \\\"should\\\" be or giving into food fads. I was always gratified to see members of the local ex-pat Japanese community eating there. And now I don't know where to sate my addiction to Japanese cuisine.

She got a corn tortilla and some grilled chicken and that's it for her taco? The lady advised it would be extra $ for any toppings which I elected to pay.

First, the employees are often hanging around chatting while the paper towel dispensers are empty and garbage litters the weight area. If equipment is out of order it usually takes a few weeks to get repaired. Cardio equipment is grimy, sticky and outdated. For those patrons who litter the areas and don't clean up on themselves, seriously get some manners. However, the lack of pride in this establishment from the employees makes it OK for rude people to trash the place. I would be embarrassed to work there in the shape it is in.

Also, while some may say it is not fair to compare something like this to \\\"Disneyland\\\", I disagree.  Disney as the parent company who has \\\"theme park\\\" entertainment down to a science would never settle for the poorly executed design and management of this experience to exist.  No reason to re-invent the wheel- pool resources from the Disney parks gurus and fix the kinks.  Several of the activities inside the experience are actual activities AT Disneyland (in the Innoventions attraction in Tomorrowland) so there should be zero \\\"kinks\\\" with those, yet there are.\\n\\nCost: For our family of 4 (2 adults 2 teens) we paid $145 for the Marvel Experience plus an additional $10 for parking and shelled out another $20 for a souvenir photo.  So at $175 we are not talking about chump change.\\n\\nTime: We had tickets for Sunday December 28th at 3pm- the web said the experience would last 90-120 minutes. We were there for 3.5 hours ( i.e. 210 minutes) from 2:45pm until 6:15pm.  Approximately 60 minutes of that was actual \\\"experience\\\" everything else was standing in line.\\n\\nWould we do it again?:\\nnot likely- at least not at the cost that it was.  Again it was nearly $30 per person\\n\\nPros:  It's Marvel so if you like Marvel you will be able to find something to like about it.\\n\\nCons: 1-interestingly enough kids 6 and under were FREE- which blows my mind because there sure were a TON of them and they take up a TON of time on the activities that those of us that PAID to be there are now having to wait for.  Due to the structure of the activities I believe every person who enters should be a paying ticket holder that would make it fair. 2- parking was an additional $10 (if you ever go to anything at Talking Stick you KNOW you have to pay for parking, this just always sucks- but at $10 per event they need to PAVE that lot- the dirt is getting old) 3- poor crowd management (read full review for details) 4- low value high cost (see full review for details of what $30 per person gets you)\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Text: I had a horrific experience at this restaurant.  \\n\\nI went with several friends during happy hour on a Friday and we were seated quickly which was a plus.\\n\\nThe acoustics are very poor due to the open floor plan.

Despite my tables location directly in front of the hostess stand and the obvious disruption caused by the spill, our table was never contacted by a manager.  Our table paid full price for everything, if you were wondering. \\n\\nThe food was mediocre.  The gravy fries were on point.  The fries were crispy and hot.  The gravy was pretty flavorful and had tons of bacon in it.  There was only a hint of the promised cheese curds, which would have made everything better.  However, if i ever come back, I will get the gravy on the side, because the fries got soggy fast.  The wings were large, moist and properly cooked, and they came out with the sauce on the side.  The wings appeared unseasoned.  The sauce was extremely basic; essentially thick tobasco.  Overall, the wings were unremarkable.  The pizza English muffins were unflavorful and had a mushy texture.  \\n \\nUnfortunately, the whole experience lacked warmth.

Ca\\u00f1a is located in the spot vacated by Louis's Fish Camp and they did a great job of remodeling the space.

With Ca\\u00f1a, the doorway is larger and more inviting and the bar is pushed back, adjoining the patio areas. The interior of the place is much darker and intimate as well. The bathrooms are in the same location but are not as pronounced.\\n\\nAs for the food... ehh... it was ok but not great.  Not even \\\"really good\\\" either.\\n\\n- Hamachi ceviche -- as other reviews have mentioned they are not traditional ceviches. They're more like sashimi slices laying on a streak of citrus sauce. Hardly enough citrus to 'cook' the hamachi. It didn't taste all that fresh and lacked flavor.\\n\\n- Short ribs -- one large short rib in a deep pool of guava glaze. The meat was very tender but didn't have much depth in flavor. A few more spices would have given it some kick and made this a great dish, but the meat all on its own was a little dull.\\n\\n- Piggy back dates -- It seems like every tapas/bocadillos place HAS to have bacon wrapped dates. I guess I should be glad that this place did, because it was the best dish of the night. Great textures (although the amount of goat cheese mousse was overkill) and great flavors.\\n\\n- Beef empanadas -- the outside of the empanadas was flaky and a little crispy. The inside could have used more beef. Almost every bite was pastry with a hint of beef. The beef tasted pretty good, I just wanted more of it.\\n\\n- Crispy shrimp -- decent flavor, not as crispy as I would have liked.\\n\\n- Sangria -- while it did taste good, it wasn't strong enough and was too sweet.

Paper is the king, efficiency is of no concern, and inconvenience to customers is the rule. (Wait, somebody said customers? who are they other than mere *things* whom money should be sucked out of at all costs?). Most of the people who work at the Blvd of the Allies office, the Parking Court, and on the phone have the aura of kings and queens; the aura that governs those who want to be in control and assert their superiority to others who actually need their services. They act as if they would be doing favors to you, whereas they are only supposed to be doing their job. The goal of the whole establishment seems to be not making parking easier for people but doing things such that they can suck the most money out of people who park (and especially those who need to park in the city boundaries) in the very limited parking resources. \\n\\nEnough of the rant. Let's move to some concrete examples. \\n\\nExample 1: I live within the city boundary, so I need to get a zone permit to park in front of my apartment. It turns out I have to renew this zone permit every year via mail. I am happy to pay more to get a 3-year or 5-year zone permit so that I do not have to deal with this snail mail renewing process which is invariably prone to the forgetfulness of human mind. But, you have no choice. You have to pay $20 to renew your residential parking permit every single year. So, what happens? I forget to pay one year because the Parking Authority did not mail me my renewal notice, and lo and behold I see a ticket on my car parked in front of my apartment. A $35 ticket for parking in a residential zone without permit. The permit itself costs only $20. How reasonable is this? A $35 ticket for a $20 permit, which did not get renewed because the Authority did not send a renewal notice.\\n\\nLet's say we accepted that. Now, I want to renew my residential permit online. I am not allowed because you cannot get or renew a residential permit online or even on the phone. You have to be physically present in front of the Authority to accomplish this monstrous task. So what do you do? You go to the Blvd of the Allies office and renew your residential parking permit, for one year. You have to sign documents, bring your lease, etc etc (Thank God some of this information is on their website, even though it might take a while to find.) So, I do that and I ask if I can dispute the $35 ticket I got for not renewing my $20 permit. Of course you can, apparently, but they do not do this sort of business at the Blvd of the Allies office: you have to make an appointment with the Pittsburgh Parking Court, go there on a separate date, explain your case to a judge (don't judges have better things to do in this city? more important problems to solve?), and pray to God that the judge actually has some common sense left in him. Good luck!  \\n\\nTechnology has really not seem to have caught on in the Parking Authority of the city of Pittsburgh -- except when they demand payment from you. If you want to simply renew your residential parking permit online or on the phone or even via snail mail, there is no way. But if they ticket you, all options are there for you to pay. You want the phone to pay your ticket? You got it. You want the internet to pay your ticket? You got it. You want the good old snail mail? You got it. You will get charged a fee for the first two (thank you very much), but you have all the convenience to fork your money over. You just cannot have the same convenience when you actually want to do the things that would prevent you from getting tickets in the future, like getting a residential parking permit.\\n\\nExample 2: They will find a way to ticket you in any way, shape, or form they can. They will not fix meters and not clearly mark where parking is disallowed, just to keep open the option of ticketing you. If there is an opening that looks like a parking spot but you are not sure, be very careful. If you are lucky once, it does not mean you will be lucky the next time. Basically, many spots are not clearly delineated, so you can get a ticket even though something looks like a spot to you and there is no sign saying \\\"No Parking.\\\" They will ticket you. And, if you want to dispute, you are in for some pain. \\n\\nExample 3: To dispute a ticket, you have to go to the court. And, the court has limited hours. There is no other way to handle a disputed ticket, even if the issue is trivial. Actually, there is a way. Their website says you can call a number if you believe the ticket is unfair and if you were issued the ticket for a very limited number of reasons. Apparently, some very limited cases can be handled without going to the court. In theory, they can... If you get an answer to your phone call, that is. Good luck with that!\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Text: Went here after work on a busy evening, when you first walk in you can see a white neon glow from the right side wall that is actually a large beer cooler- it looks like you can just walk up and grab your own beer from the cooler-awesome!\\nHad the special for dinner, stuffed peppers with red potatoes- it was decent, not out of this world good, just OK.

We ordered Ketel One martinis, and from our table we watched the martinis sit in the shaker for nearly ten minutes before the bartender poured them into glasses.  When they finally got to us they tasted mostly like water.\\n\\nNext, the appetizer disaster.  My partner ordered the scallops and lobster appetizer.  After one bite of the lobster, he realized that the lobster was NOT COOKED.  Everyone at the table inspected the appetizer and agreed that it was not cooked.  The restaurant manager agreed too, so she sent it back to the kitchen and brought my partner another one.  Well, the second appetizer had cooked lobster but RAW scallops!  So we had to send that one back too.  Yikes.  At this point, my partner declined a third try on the appetizer.\\n\\nBecause of this terrible screw up, the restaurant then decided to bring our entire table free garlic pasta appetizers (without asking us first).  Unfortunately, my partner does not eat fresh garlic, so they had to take that back.  Then, again without asking us first the restaurant brought my partner a foie gras appetizer, which he also couldn't eat because he doesn't like foie gras.  Even though the restaurant meant well by these gestures, they only made the situation worse because they didn't ask us what we wanted.\\n\\nNow on to the wine steward disaster.  When we sat down, I consulted with the wine steward over wines and selected both white and red wine for our table.  Well, the red wine didn't show up until our main course was served, but no white wine -- the wine steward had completely forgotten about the white wine that I had selected!  We had to remind him.  This is not the type of wine steward service that I expect from a five star restaurant!\\n\\nAnd finally, the main course disaster.  Three of our four main courses arrived barely warm.  At that point, my partner sent his main course back to the kitchen and decided to not eat dinner altogether.  I ate my sea bass main course and it was decent but would have been better hotter.  Not one of my dinner guests raved about the food at Le Cirque.\\n\\nSo overall, my wonderful idea of a fantastic dinner for my partner and my two longtime friends turned into something out of a Stephen King novel.  I was very disappointed.\\n\\nOf course, the restaurant apologized profusely for serving us uncooked seafood and for the comedy of errors (especially since the manager witnessed all of it firsthand), and comped my partner's dinner, the watered down martinis and our bottle of red wine.

Way too much money for the quality and service at this place.\\n\\nAfterwards, we spoke to the general manager of the Bellagio Hotel, where we were also staying, about this horrible experience.  The general manager took my partner's drivers license number and address in order to run a background check on him, and then promised to contact us the following day about our situation.  The next day we received a call from the hotel's Risk Manager who offered us two free nights stay and free dinner for two on a future stay once my partner signed a legal liability release for the hotel and restaurant.  Yes, everything always comes down to the lawyers!!

How will I ever eat again, if it isn't a dish from e?  I don't think I can manage real food anymore haha.

The bread was steamed brioche bun, so fluffy the best brioche I'd ever had and the only time I've experienced it steamed.  The ham was iberico, the best ham in the world!  Truly.  And some sort of Spanish goat cheese.  For a dish that looked so unassuming, the flavors popped.  I wanted to order a whole box of these just to take home!  \\n**Spanish tapas experience all in one.

Somewhere on the plate is an english muffin, but that's not as important as what's rocking out on top of the muffin.

Come on. That many eggs can rarely do a body good. Also, get the banana bread. Oh dear God.

We call our server over and tell him that people who sat down after are already finished with their meal, he says \\\"Oh, don't worry your food will be right out.\\\" An indication that he was clearly incompetent was when he put in a food order after ours and is  bringing it out before ours. We tell him that we would need our food to to go because we had places to be. About 10 minutes later the manager comes out (with no food in hand) and says that they must have lost our ticket in the back and he will go back there and see what's going on.

I was definitely a happy camper. \\n\\nQueen Cut Prime Rib of Beef 32-(5 stars) Originally, we were eyeing the King Cut but that was WAY too much cow. The Queen Cut is a pretty generous portion. I was able to sample it and I was pleasantly surprised. It was actually tasty and extremely tender. \\n\\nSides: \\nLoaded Mashed Potatoes 8 - (3 stars) This consisted of Yukon Gold Mashed potatoes with sour cream, butter, chives and cheese. It was OK, I've tasted better. \\n\\nFresh Steamed Asparagus 9 -(3 stars) Cooked just right but didn't care for the hollandaise sauce that it was topped with. \\n\\nDessert: \\nEnglish Toffee Pudding Cake 8- (4stars) This sticky toffee and moist cake was superb! \\n\\nCr\\u00e8me Brulee 8 - (4 stars) This was made just right, not too sweet and the right texture. \\n\\nNice atmosphere and great staff.

It was fine, the most impressive part being the walls filled with Chicago greats and not having to wait for a table at 2:30 PM on a Sunday.  OH and there are several good sized, good quality TVs for your sports viewing pleasure.  Which was nice since the US Open was on.  \\n\\nWe started with the house salad -- it's not an antipasto or a great house salad at that -- it's ICEBERG lettuce, cucumbers, onions and tomatoes.  Their house Italian is more of a balsamic which I really didn't mind, but the salad was less than impressive.  I am not an iceberg lettuce fan, but luckily my husband is and he finished it off.  \\n\\nTheir tomato sauce is a little on the tangy side, which is fine.  My daughter wasn't crazy about it, but I do realize tomato sauce is a personal preference kind of thing.  She ordered the spaghetti and meatball (one big meatball) and was satisfied.  She also ordered garlic bread which was waaaay garlickly - I know, I know, it's supposed to be, but my husband and I could still taste the garlic in our teeth two hours later!!  \\n\\nThe pizza . . . . they told us it'd be 45 minutes, but it was actually 25.  Bonus!  Maybe it's because we ordred the homemade sausage, pepperoni and green pepper and didn't stuff it full?  It was good - it wasn't great, not quite like thick, oozing goodness of Lou Malnati's or Pizzeria Due in Downtown Chicago, but it was still delicious.  The crust wasn't too thick or too doughy which in my book, is a good thing.  If I ever crave deep dish, I would probably, maybe return, but I wouldn't make a special trip to do so.

Disgusting rooms for a lot of money!  My husband and I recently stayed here for his 35th birthday for one night.  Since it was a special occasion, we decided to splurge on the room (nearly $350 for a king, fountain view room - that's with the M Life discount).  We live in AZ and typically visit Vegas 4 times per year, so this was not our first time here.  \\n\\nOur first room was 16070.  Upon walking in, the room reeked of mildew.  It smelled like the carpet had been flooded for weeks and then dried off and put back to use.  We called the front desk and they moved us very quickly to a different room just down the hall (16048).  This room did not smell....or so we thought.  After being out and about and returning to our room after midnight, we just wanted a good night's rest.  We climbed into bed and realized that the sheets and bedding all reeked of mildew as well!!!  DISGUSTING!!!  Seeing as it was so late and we were exhausted, we did not want to call housekeeping and wait for them to strip our seats or have to pack up and move rooms once again.  So, we both slept uncomfortably fully clothed.

A few weeks ago told a different story. I had a craving for curry on a Monday night but Saffron is closed on Monday. I did not know this until after I tried three doors before seeing their hours posted on the first door revisited. I was frustrated. Today, though, is Wednesday and Saffron is open.  I parked at about 5:45 in an open and empty lot. As I approached, a man opened the door and warmly welcomed me in. Good impression number one. I was seated immediately as the restaurant was mostly empty much to my surprise. When I was seated I noticed the strong aroma of the many exotic spices I would be enjoying shortly. I also noticed the Indian music lending itself to a comforting and authentic dining experience. Good impression number two. Within less than a minute of being seated I was brought a glass of water, a food menu, a wine menu, a basket of crispy flat bread stuff (apologies for not knowing the true name), and two sauces. A mint sauce and a tamarind sauce. The latter of the two sauces was my favorite. I took a few minutes to familiarize myself with the menu. I settled upon Palak Chicken and a side of Garlic Naan.  The naan came out quickly and was absolutely delicious. It was hot, crisp, and chewy with plenty of minced garlic on top. A few minutes later my Palak Chicken came out in a hot bowl and accompanied with    long grain rice in a separate bowl. The Palak was a brilliant green from the spinach. It was topped with cream and a sprig of cilantro. A beautiful presentation to be sure. I had trouble finding the chicken until I spooned it on to my plate. It was there hiding out amongst the spinach base. It was not the most tender chicken I have had at an Indian restaurant but chicken does not need to be fork tender to be good. It still fell apart in my mouth. Good impression number three. I ate all of my rice but took my Palak Chicken and Garlic Naan home to have for lunch the next day. My check came as I was bagging up my leftovers. It had a smiley face drawn on it. Talk about service with a smile.  Good impression number four. This was very much a comfortable and relaxing dining experience. From the soft spoken and friendly waiter to the delicious food cooked to my spice request of 3 (out of 10), my night at Saffron was just what the doctor ordered. I will be back but probably not all too soon. It is a little  high priced as Indian cuisine tends to be.

It looked busy outside on the patio so I figured this must be a pretty decent pizza place. I have only been to one other Fox restaurant and that is True Food Kitchen, which I like a lot. This place..... meh.\\n\\nWe walk in, and the first thing I notice to be different is its not a sit down, order, and food is brought to you kind of place. Its a order at the register, wait for food to come out kind of place. Which I was not expecting and frankly it confused me. The prices were extremely high for this kind of establishment. We ordered a few different items. The portabello and artichoke bruschetta, $4.50. Was it worth the money? No way. It was one thick slice of bread spread with a thin layer of goat cheese, topped with a minuscule amount of peppers, artichokes, and hardly any mushrooms. It did taste good, but definitely not a good value for the money. We also ordered the portabello and artichoke pizza $9.75, as well as the mushroom and arugula pizza, $9.75. I don't know where this place gets off charging the amount of money they do for how little food they give you. Their pizzas are a thin crust, with a thin layer of sauce, and a thin layer of cheese and toppings. Do people actually come here on a regular basis and pay this much for such a thin pizza? If they do something must be wrong with them. Either that or they are so dazzled by the Fox name that they don't care where they throw their cash. Now don't get me wrong. The pizzas all tasted really good, but I would not come here again because of the prices of the food here, which is the only reason for the two star review. I don't just review taste, I also review value. And the value here for what you get is none. \\n\\nAlso, places like this that don't pay their employees at least minimum wage really bother me. At the register you pay and they have a tip line. I don't usually tip at these kinds of places where all the service I get is food being brought out to me or if I do I don't tip the usual amount, but I was so flustered by this I had no idea what to do. I even asked the girl do people usually tip, and she told me they were tip based pay employees. Seriously? They don't do anything worth the tip. At that point I felt obligated to tip so I did. And I still feel like I shouldn't have. All in all I spent $34 dollars on about $5 worth of ingredients.

I was shocked she didn't even want to try to earn my business. If you're looking for an overpriced place for your pooch where they'll call you a liar on the phone, not apologize for it, then not even bother to earn your business, Tailwinds is it! Thankfully, I know I'm a great customer and I have plenty of options when it comes to spending my money on my pet.\\n\\n\\n\\nI'd love to try this place out, but as someone who knows dogs and knows my dog, the idea of paying someone $10 to find out what I already know about my dog is ridiculous.

It felt like I was being called a liar. By the end of the conversation, all I could say was to tell the owner she's losing business and to have a nice day.\\n\\nNow, signing on to Yelp, I see there are some free days for new clients. Well, maybe if the young lady had bothered to mention that I might have reconsidered.

Sadly, the day I was calling about requires my dog and I to be up at Villa la Paws for an evening class and our first day care experience there was not stellar.

My first disappointment was taking an ordinary Chinese restaurant-type plastic container out of the bag that was only three-quarters full.  It turned out not to matter:  the soup was so unbearably spicy that we couldn't finish it.  It also had half the amount of chicken that our dine-in portion had.  \\n\\nFour vegetable spring rolls were decent, but very greasy.  \\n\\nWe ordered our main dish, Pad Thai, as a chicken-beef-shrimp combination.  It had a \\\"generous\\\" helping of two rather small shrimp, chewy and flavorless beef, and some tender chicken.  This dish is usually very bland at other Thai restaurants, but this one was very spicy.  I didn't mind that, since it didn't cause smoke to come out of my ears like the soup did.  But the noodles were rubbery, and if it had chopped peanuts, there weren't enough to taste them.  A disappointment.\\n\\nI guess it was too good to be true, but we'll go back to the other Thai restaurants we used to go to before our hopes were raised by the opening of Thai-Style Noodle House, which is so much closer to our home.  Those hopes sadly have been dashed.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Text: Howzit!?\\n\\nDecent Thai food. Average atmosphere.

We ordered a side of kim chee (pass on this) which was not good and probably out of a grocery store jar and a side of mac salad which was good BUT had too much mayo and was too salty for my liking. The mac salad had good texture, crunch, and color though. The portions are huge! My bro ordered the small saimin and it was comparable to a regular portion at any ramen house in socal.

That's when great happy hour specials come into play, such as at the recently discovered 5th and Wine in Old Town Scottsdale. Opened by the same owners as the fantastic Humble Pie and the new Living Room Wine Bar in Chandler, they create a space that's welcoming, relaxed and comfortable. Service is polished with an attractive and eager staff that seem genuine and friendly.\\n\\nDay drinkers can delight from 3pm-7pm daily, including weekends, with 5th & Wines great happy hour with glasses of wine priced at $5. The deals don't stop there, also offering a short list of fantastic draft beers and well drinks both at only $4.\\n\\n5th and Wine also offers several well priced appetizers to pair up with one of their amazing wines. Salty cured meats always taste so good while sipping drinks, and the Prosciutto Wrapped Breadsticks ($4) filled the ordered perfectly. They take long thin bread sticks then wrap them with thin slices of cured pork and finish them horseradish cream, incredibly addictive.\\n\\nServed with crunchy jicama and ranch dressing for dipping, the Spicy Chicken Drumettes ($4) might be the best deal on the menu. In total there were 12 plump and meaty drumettes that were cooked until tender then slathered in a spicy vinegary wing sauce, basic I know but executed perfectly.\\n\\nThe center piece to all of the eating and drinking were definitely the Bruschetta ($9.95 for 6). Starting with a thick slab of toasted artisan bread, you choose from 8 different preparations ranging from mild to sublime. Standouts included a tasty peppercorn crusted steak with dollops of nose clearing creamy horseradish and for the wine centric, apples with brie and fig jam which was then drizzled with honey and agave syrup. After trying so many, my absolute favorite had prosciutto, mascarpone cheese, figs and tomato jam. Salty, sweet, creamy and chewy, this touched on everything I love about well prepared Bruschetta.\\n\\nAt these prices you can easily put together a hearty meal but why stop there? 5th and Wine also offers a great selection of salads, sandwiches entrees and daily specials on their regular menu.\\n\\nNot to be missed, the 5th and Wine Burger ($11.95) starts with all natural ground beef then is topped with Cambozola or White Cheddar, caramelized onions and organic arugula. I opted for the addition of an organic fried egg for only $1.50 more which added the creaminess of hot egg yolk to each beefy bite. Almost as good as the burger, the 5th Ave Sausage ($10.95) uses Schreiner's sausage, caramelized onions, roasted peppers, arugula and whole grain mustard on toasted focaccia. However on my last visit, like the burger, the sausage was served on tender flaky brioche, a perfect substitute.\\n\\nJust think in the time it took to read this another happy hour started.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Text: Very nice menu and atmosphere, worth trying.\\nIn our case, the side dish was cold, hmm.\\nKitchen and staff did their best to make it right, but still...\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Text: This place is fun and very good for kids.

The main selling point of this hotel is probably its location. It's just a short walk away from Guy-Concordia station on the green line as well as Lucien L'Allier station on the orange line. It is close to the Centre Bell, in case you want to watch a hockey game, the Gare Central VIA rail station, and the Centre Eaton shopping mall and surrounding shops and restaurants. \\n\\nIn terms of the hotel room, it was pretty standard/basic. We stayed in room 610, which was on the 6th floor - apparently that is the executive floor. The room just looked like a regular room though with two beds, a flat screen TV, and a really tiny washroom. At least it was clean though, and the beds were pretty comfortable. It's not the most glamorous looking hotel, but it's alright and gets the job done for about $107/night on a Saturday night. A few things to note about our room: our safe didn't work, there was a handle missing from the closet door, and I found a towel with a small stain on it.\\n\\nThe staff at the hotel was pretty friendly and helpful for the most part. We had a slight hiccup on our first night when we went to check in around 3 pm, which is the standard check in time, and were told that our room wasn't ready yet and they were still preparing it. We ended up having to sit in the lobby for an extra 10-15 minutes until they finally called us over to give us our key. While it wasn't a huge deal, I wasn't impressed with the fact that the room wasn't ready for us when it should have been - it's not even like we arrived early or anything. Also, unfortunately for us, our room was right across from the elevator doors. It made it convenient to get to/from our room, but also made it so it was quite loud with all the people coming in and out. The walls are not super sound proof or anything, so we could hear people in the hallway late at night.\\n\\nThere is free unlimited wifi here. However, it was really slow and kept cutting in and out.\\n\\nOverall, I liked the location of the hotel and wouldn't really have a problem staying here again in the future for like one or two nights.

Being a Lawrenceville local, I have been to Belvederes many times. There are nights when I enjoy the atmosphere and nights when I stay for a drink and then leave. This is mainly dependent upon the crowd and day of the week. I've listed some of the positive and negative qualities of the place below. \\n\\nNegative aspects of Belvedere's are as follows: 1.) you can usually count on a large crowd of stinky, sweaty people who don't believe in bathing 2.) You've got to be able to withstand a lot of cigarette smoke as this is allowed inside of the premises - and most of the people who frequent Belvederes smoke - a lot. 3.) The poorly lit atmosphere makes it difficult to get around at times (especially if you are crocked) 4.) The dirty environment isn't for those with a weak stomach - this is a dive bar. 5.) They do not serve food so you are out of luck if you want to grab a bite.\\n\\nPositive aspects of Belvederes are 1.) the drinks are cheap 2.) 80's night is a total blast (Thursdays) 3.) Always a wide range of interesting people to talk to and see 4.) It is right across the street from the late night Wendy's and right next door to the 24 hour Get Go. (snacks and cigarettes!) 5.) If the crowd sucks you can easily walk to another bar down the street. It is on Butler St. so everything is easily accessible here. 6.) The staff is nice 7.) The smoking indoors policy is nice if you are a smoker 8.) They've got pinball machines and pool tables. 9.) Belvedere's hosts many fun themed nights (80's night, 90's night, DJs, bands, Down and Derby, Pudding Wrestling, Karaoke, Burlesque Shows, etc etc....)\\n\\nAll in all it is a place worth checking out.

When one of our party changed her order, subbing a MRKT chopped salad (with pancetta in every bite!) for the butternut squash soup (on the suggestion of the woman at the table next to ours, who sent hers back with a critique of \\\"not enough squash\\\" and \\\"Wolfgang Puck's is better\\\"), he left the slightly less expensive soup on the bill instead of the salad, saving us a dollar or two. (Of course, that was added to his tip.)\\n\\nThe Blue Nut Salad is an interesting combination of mixed greens, halved red and green grapes, and candied pecans, tossed in a fresh, peppery sort of vinaigrette and served with a pinch bowl of crumbled blue cheese. I say \\\"interesting\\\" because while I think I know what they were trying to achieve -- balancing the sweetness of the pecans and grapes with the strong cheese -- I think they missed the mark. Also, I should add that while I was happy with the amount of \\\"fixins\\\" in my salad-as-entree (though the pecans were stuck together in a few big chunks), two of our party shared this salad before their entree and were disappointed with what seemed to be just a pile of leaves.\\n\\nWhen the two that ordered prime rib received their entrees -- WOW! These were big, tender cuts of meat. The flavor was a little lacking, but for a 2-for-1 special, you definitely got your money's worth. The same might not be said if we'd paid full price for each of these. The last member of our group ordered the tuna mahi appetizer as an entree; wonderful flavor, again tender, and the presentation was beautiful.\\n\\nWe split between the group three sides: a sweet potato, baked potato, and asparagus. I don't think I've ever seen a larger sweet potato in my life! The potatoes each came with a trio of toppings. The asparagus came, as requested, drizzled with lemon juice; this is, with a little salt and pepper, the best way to eat asparagus, in my opinion.\\n\\nFull up, we passed on dessert and were left comfortably at our table to chat, no rush. All in all, MRKT seems best suited to big eaters and date nights -- each of you can order an entree and split one of the large-portioned sides.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Text: Weird place.

I knew of the one in PA and had always wanted to try it.  I didn't even know of this location until I entered the Miracle Mile shops inside Planet Hollywood.  I was primed and ready to go on the meat-fest extravaganza.  $39 for the meat only and $50 for the meat and seafood, both of which included cold salad bar visits.  Feeling adventurous, I super-sized to include the seafood, just out of curiosity.\\n\\nThe salad bar was OK, they had some cold and hot vegetable dishes as well as smoked salmon and salad stuff.  Once the food started arriving, I made sure only to try one piece of each meat and no more.  Unfortunately, when eating that much meat, I realized that it was hard to appreciate and taste them individually flavor wise.  In the interest of saving your stomach, I recommend you avoid the brazilian sausage which came out dry, the lamb which tasted a little too game-ish, and the turkey wrapped in bacon, wasn't too impressive.  The seafood consisted of scallops wrapped in bacon, grilled salmon, tempura battered cod, and shrimps with a butter sauce.  The salamon was dry and the cod's flavor was masked by the deep frying.  I'd only recommend the shrimp out of all the four and better to order them as a skewer than doing the rodizio.\\n\\nMake sure not to order the coconaut mojito on their cocktail menu.  Coconaut and mint don't go together despite what our server enthusiastic words.  I had the red wine sangria which was okay...it wasn't as fruity as I have had before in Spanish tapas restaurants.\\n\\nAverage cost per diner for dinner is $70.  I'm glad I got to try this once and this place is worth at least a try but I can't imagine coming here regularly.

My girlfriend ordered the veggie burrito. \\n\\nThe rolled tacos were excellent, perfectly fried, not too greasy. The salsa bar had a good variety of green and red sauces with varying spice levels. My carne asada burrito was huge with lots of meat and beans. The guac was just ok. The veggie burrito was much better in my opinion--I'll have to order it next time.

They make you buy a bottle of Fiji water for $5!

I have a 13.5 pounds shih tzu, with no behavioral problems whatsoever, she is sweet as pie however, as you can imagine, she is not always trilled to go to the groomers, she's a bit nervous. After waiting for Erin around 15 minutes, she finally comes over to talk to me about my little dog, she's very hesitant to take her and has no rapport with my little dog, she asked me if she has been to the groomers before and I replied yes. She has not even touched my dog, and she is already talking about to get her with a different groomer that arrives at 2 pm, when my appointment was at 8:00 am!!!\\nSo after a little chat about the services I want, she tells me that she will try to do it but, if my dog was going to get snippy she will call me to pick her up (my fellow yelpers, please keep in mind that I have a 13.5 pounds shih tzu) Kind of second guessing myself, I decided to give her a shot, I asked the personnel at the reception if I was good to go, they told me yes, I walked out of the place, I barely got to my truck and someone came over and told me that Erin will not groom my dog because wouldn't let her do anything. I was offered the other groomer at 2 pm, that I could leave my dog there until then, to which I answered, NO, thank you! You couldn't handle her for 3 or 4 minutes and you want me to leave her here for 6 hours? I don't think so! Anyway at this point I am just glad that this happened, because if she didn't get along with the dog since the beggining and still done the grooming who knows how my little pooch would have been treated.\\nThankfully there are other places to go to in town, and even if my current groomer is in the opposite side of town, I much rather take it with a person that knows how to treat their main clientele, which is my pet. \\nGranted! my pet didn't get groomed but I WILL NOT RECOMMEND this place!!!\\nAt work, sooner or later you will run into a challenge, and if you can't overcome the littlest obstacles you should not be doing that.\\nI've noticed that this place has 5 stars, but only has 5 reviews...\\nAnyway! have a good one and keep yelping!!!\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Text: Went there for lunch.\\nA place worthy a $6.7(7 for credit cards) buffet with a drink.

It always puts me in a good mood and makes me wish I was on vacation. So, since I was on vacation and in a good mood, I figure what better way to embrace that Buffett feeling than to give Margaritaville a try. Never having been here, I went in with relatively high hopes... at least for a good margarita. \\n\\nUnfortunately, that wasn't the case. I had the pomegranate margarita -- on the rocks -- and it was really nothing special. For $7.75, I expected much more drink with much more alcohol. And, then there was the food. Honestly, I've had better fare at Chili's or TGI Fridays. I had the lunch special of 1/2 a Cuban sandwich and house salad.  When our food came out, I looked at my sandwich, and thought, \\\"Is this it?\\\" It was one heck of a tiny 1/2 sandwich. And, the salad -- well, it reminded me of a hospital cafeteria's pre-made salad -- dry lettuce, uber-dry flakes of carrots and some bite-size pieces of re-hydrated cucumbers. Plus, the amount of dressing the gave me just barely made eating the salad bearable. \\n\\nThe \\\"atmosphere\\\" was okay. I expected it to be beachy and laid-back, but it was a bit too kitschy for me.  It reminded me of a place you'd visit at a theme park. But, hey, maybe that is Buffet's dream... create a theme park called Buffetland, where people can fish for parrots while drinking margaritas.\\n\\nMy final complaint is the service. It was descent at first. The waitress was nice enough and attentive enough. However, when we were ready for our check, it took forrrrrever for her to bring it to us.  She had told us as she took our plates that she'd be right back with the check.  Well, as I watched her go to another table, then to the register (thinking she was processing our bill), then into the kitchen, back to the other table, then back to the register (thinking she was processing our bill THIS time), then to another table, she finally came past ours. Before she could rush away, I loudly said we needed the check because we were in a hurry. She nodded and FINALLY got us our check. \\n\\nI'll give the waitress the benefit of the doubt, and chalk it up to a perfect storm of me being anxious about being late for an appointment and annoyed that she was taking so long, and her having bad timing or being busy.  \\n\\nNevertheless, that wasn't the only disappointment I had with Margaritaville.  The food was blah, the prices were too high for the low quality food, and the atmosphere and decor of the place was rather cheesy.

We called and made a reservation, and I was very excited.\\n\\nFirst strike: I called early in the day to make a reservation for 8 people at 6:30 PM. I called several minutes ahead of time as a courtesy to let them know we would be arriving shortly (because it was a Friday night and I wanted to know if they were on schedule). I reiterated our number of guests and the time. When we arrived, our table was set up for the wrong number of people, and the table they chose was completely impractical for the special needs of some of our guests (which were divulged over the phone both times). There were 5 other tables dining in the restaurant. FIVE. There was no reason, especially after my phone call, that this should have happened. We waited around for changes to be made, which took longer than it should have. However, since we're all human, I shrugged it off and got ready for my meal.\\n\\nSecond strike: We ordered drinks, and I can safely say they were the worst drinks we've ever had. Not one person at our table enjoyed their cocktail; they were overpriced, contained almost no liquor, and were improperly mixed. We stuck to (very overpriced) beer for the rest of the night.\\n\\nThird strike: When it came time to order dinner, we asked the waiter about some of the items on the menu. He seemed to know what 3 of the dishes were, and when we asked him some opinion questions, it became obvious that he only told us to pick these dishes because he was able to pronounce their names. He had NO clue what he was talking about, and we decided to take our chances by ordering a variety of dishes. I also ordered the shrimp cake appetizer.\\n\\nFourth strike: I waited for said appetizer for 40 minutes. In that time two more tables arrived, but three left. Our waiter did not offer refills or check on our table while we waited, and by the time my appetizer showed up, I was about to start eating the basket the bread arrived in. They came closer with my plate, I could hear angels singing, and as soon as they set it down I deflated. I had two silver dollar sized cakes with an extremely large amount of greens on my plate. My husband and I each got three bites between the two cakes, and they were very small bites. I paid $10 for this?\\n\\nFifth strike: Our meals came out within 5 minutes of our appetizer (sigh), and again the portion sizes were disappointing. My steak was cooked appropriately, but it was the only one at the table that was cooked correctly. My husband ordered the lamb shank, and it was tough and poorly seasoned. My mother in law had the lasagna, which was cold. The only person who enjoyed their meal was my sister, who ordered roasted chicken.\\n\\nBetween the poor service, the inability to honor our reservation properly, the awful drinks, the long waits, and the bad food, I'm amazed that this restaurant is so well reviewed.

Not to mention, the service was spectacular on both visits. \\n\\nOur group of 10 dined at Hash House twice for breakfast while in Vegas over Christmas. Staying at the Flamingo put us just a quick brisk walk to the Imperial Palace and up the escalator dedicated to Hash House. Getting to the restaurant before 9AM both times, the staff was easily able to accommodate our large group. The restaurant was largely empty that early, but did begin to fill up around 10AM. Our servers, on both occasions, were courteous, efficient, enthusiastic, and even charming. For me, that can really put a dining experience over the top. \\n\\nWhile the food was VERY good, being The Griddle cafe fanatic that I am, I cannot give Hash House 5 stars. Their pancakes (snickers) and french toast did not compare to the deliciousness that is The Griddle. \\n\\nBUT, the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles is note worthy. Perfectly Fried Chicken breast that were very moist with a crisp, not overly salty, crust hinted with sage was probably the best fried chicken I recall having (although I rarely eat fried chicken). The waffles were inventive with the strips of bacon entwined in the batter in stead of bacon bits mixed in the waffle. This was perfect as the bacon didn't overpower, but accented the waffle and still gave you the satiety of have two strips of bacon with your meal. The maple reduction tasted more like balsamic, but really highlighted the dish and I recommend using the sauce on your food and not avoiding it. \\nIt was just YUM! My boyfriend and I split the dish and it was perfect for two people. The next visit we split the french toast which was just as huge with a griddle banana that was still in the skin split atop the super thick sliced bread. The banana was disturbing at first being black from the griddle, but was actually delicious and perfectly cooked. It went well with the french toast. \\n\\nMany people at our table went with the Tractor Special, which was well received and the most traditional style breakfast item they offer. No one tried their hash, sadly. \\n\\nAny meal on the menu, if you can split it with someone, DO IT!

After studying the menus for many minutes, debating on trying three courses (app, entree, and dessert), or just two main entrees, and finally decided on ordering the Bacon and blue cheese burger, with green chile mac to start, and then later on going with the cheeseburger (cheddar) and subbed sweet potato fries for an extra $1.25.  (Perhaps she's not a sweet potato fry fan, or maybe she is and she didn't like the way they were prepared here?  I had to find out for myself.)  The burger patties weren't of high-quality-- I found them consisting of more fillers than meat and too fatty, yet not very flavorful.

Same thing with the sweet potato fries-- too soggy, even after I'd requested \\\"extra-crispy,\\\" and not a lot of flavor.  The green chile mac was the only decent item I had.  Back to the burgers, I found it strange that the bacon and blue cheeseburger didn't come with any veggie trimmings (\\\"only the cheeseburgers have them\\\"), but I was given a plate of shredded lettuce and tasteless tomato slices when I asked.  The cheddar cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ#LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ did come with lettuce and, even more interestingly, more flavorful and redder, tomato slices.\\n\\nThe happy hour prices seem like a good deal, and it seems like a decent place to hang out and watch sports on TV, or to just  meet with friends, if hanging out at home, or someone else's, isn't feasible.

Otherwise you have to sit at the bar or wait for a table to open up. There aren't a lot of them, and the last one was taken by the party they walked in before us. So we ended up sitting at the bar.

He answered all of our questions and even offered samples of beer we were asking about. We split some kind of queso dip with spinach and chorizo in it. I was enjoying it a lot until I got a bite of something super spicy and I had to stop for a few minutes. I'm not exaggerating, it was painfully spicy. And not even the good kind of spicy; burning pain kind of spicy. I ordered a burger for my entree. It was a spiced burger with bacon, barbecue sauce, avocado, and a huge hunk of cheese. It was such a thick slice of cheese that it didn't even melt all the way through. I picked off the unmelted chunks and took my first bite. I cringed as the taste of burnt food filled my mouth. After closer inspection I discovered it was the bacon. It tasted like the residue from all the other food that had been cooked in that spot on the cooktop. So burnt bacon and unmelted cheese aside, the actual burger was just ok. It was seasoned nicely and not to greasy, but there was nothing extraordinary about it. I honestly expected more after all the hype from my friends and the bartender. The fries were delicious and crispy, but not a lot of places can screw up fries. My friends got meat skewers and a pasta dish. I didn't try either dish but they looked and smelled good. So the food was fine.

When I go to a restaurant I'm paying for not just a meal, but the staff that's making me feel like a valued guest. This place is adorable and trendy. It feels kind of like you're walking into an exclusive club where only the cool people can eat. I love that part if it. However I don't love the sense of pretentiousness that this place has. I was told they have a policy where they can turn away anyone with a less than totally understanding attitude. In a way this is beneficial to help keep the assholes away, but at the same time it's a service industry. They must be doing well enough that they don't care if people leave and never want to come back. They also don't split checks, and don't split plates. I feel that these are easy enough accommodations that should be made for your paying guests. I just didn't feel like a valued customer here. It felt more like they were just waiting for me to leave so that they can fill my seat with a regular that is going to drink all night. \\n\\nI think this is the thing that bothered me the most.

Having stayed at other hotels not in the middle of the strip before, discovering that the Tropicana was much more south than what was ideal, we made the most of it and understood there would be some travelling in the car.  Okay, no problem.  We made dinner reservations further up the strip and booked show tickets at Planet Hollywood.  We were set.\\n\\nWe arrive in Vegas around 1:30pm, and decide to have lunch first before checking in, since it was too early to do so and our lunch reservation was North Strip.  After lunch and some games, we head down a little bit after 4pm (check-in begins at 3), and that's when the trouble starts.  4pm, and our room wasn't ready?  Hmmm, okay, how long, we ask?  About 45 mins to an hour.  Ugh.\\n\\nSo, we take whatever is available, which is a smoking room (we had reserved a non-smoking one), and as the woman is giving us our keys, we hear the party checking in next to us getting keys for their NON-SMOKING room.  What???  We ask, are there no other non-smoking rooms left, even if we upgraded?  No, she said.  Nothing we can do about it... can't wait an hour for the other room because we had show tickets... so we headed to our smoking floor and our smoking room.\\n\\nWhich, brings us back to the beginning.  Smoking room wasn't bad.  Had a bit of a smell but once you get the air going, it didn't linger.  The room was clean and the beds were comfy.  And the HD TV actually had an HD signal.  Awesome.\\n\\nSo, next time, when you book, call ahead to see if the room is ready, and if you are doing things in the middle of the strip, stay closer to where you'll be.  The Trop, as cool as it was to actually stay there, isn't worth the trouble (or the trouble parking in the small garage), and you'll most likely think you're getting your money's worth elsewhere.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Text: Job fair today!\\n\\nI've been here twice: once for a Pet Expo and yesterday for the Goodwill Career Expo.

We were told it was a once-a-year thing, and were both SO glad we tried it. It was a \\\"deconstructed Thanksgiving dinner\\\" made into a lasagna. Noodles were layered with mozzarella, pulled turkey meat, stuffing, etc. It was topped with a basil prosciutto gravy, which I had only one complaint about-- that I didn't order extra. It was SO flavorful, and really set off the dish. It also came with fresh cranberry sauce that was literally the best I have ever had. I typically don't even eat cranberry sauce, but this was really exceptional.  \\nThe cannolis we had for desert were AH-MAZING. Do not go there and leave without eating them!

However, when you go to sign up, it is mandatory that you buy one of their locks (at almost $20) and insurance ($9 per month).  These are presented as mandatory charges, not options.

I contacted management, and claimed I would be reporting on this issue of apartment complexes stealing peoples money via- 'multiple media sources.') At the time, they refused to comment- Mimi claims it is written in their contract that the application fee is nonrefundable. (HUH ?) However I explained we had never gotten that far in the application process! (ha ha) There are a few apartment complexes out there who will not charge you a RIPOFF application fee or an administration fee, though rare- I strongly suggest TO ANY RENTERS that you do your homework to find them, and negotiate terms that are acceptable to you, and not these 'thieving management companies' who only see renters at targets to pay fees too. I also suggest if one of these companies rips you off, REPORT THEM! Goto Ripoffreport.com, and tell Ed Magedson you support bringing criminals in business to justice! And spread the word around and warn others about apartment complexes that have bad management practices, and share the good ones too! good ones deserve to be recognized as well for their commitment to good business in the community- and the people they serve.

I was going to only give this place 2 stars (see below) but because this place was not dumpy like other Chinese restaurants and actually was clean and comfortable, this was part of the reason why I raised my rating. It reminded me of when I was a kid in 80s and would go to Steak & Ale with my family. It was very dark inside, which I love when it's 110 degrees outside, with dark furniture and windows you can see out of, unlike other Chinese places where they have to keep their windows shaded or blocked out for some odd reason. But this place has nothing to hide. Upon entering it is nice to see a full bar and to be greeted right away. I believe this is a family restaurant, and you can see the pride in the way the place is kept up. It is super clean, not dusty or dingy, and the bathroom is immaculate. Nice touch, even though the sun had not set yet, was the placement of lit candles on EVERY table, and only a few were occupied. I also noticed a fireplace, which must be nice if they light it in the winter.\\n\\nFOOD: one word, BLAND! I just don't understand. From appetizer to entree, everything was missing either sweet, salt, or both. The fried wontons could have a used a lot more filling and the \\\"sweet\\\" orangey sauce was not even sweet. What?! The fried dumplings looked like they stuck to the pan, as they were slightly black and some were broken from when they tried to remove from the pan (probably not enough oil, or they walked away for too long). The familiar sauce that came with it was not salty enough so I just used soy sauce. The Kung Pao chicken was unlike any I've had before. Where were the red and green bell peppers? Missing. Where was the heat, even though it was in red to indicate spicy on the menu? Missing. It was just chicken, lots of green onion bottoms, peanuts, and those whole red chiles no one eats but is supposed to add heat. The sesame chicken, usually with a very sweet sauce, was not. The chicken was okay, but slightly overcooked, noticeable by the very dark brown fried coating. I didn't like the tangerine beef: when you have any meat sliced thin, hello, it must be cooked no more than a minute or two or tough, as it was in this case. Think beef jerky. I noticed that the restaurant kept filling up with old people and I thought that maybe a nursing home was nearby, but then it dawned on me; they like bland food so this place was like their mother ship!\\n\\nSERVICE: This also led me to raise a star as the service was stellar.

I ordered 30 meals for a lunch we provide to senior citizens and had a horrible experience. To start, it was difficult to place the order because the manager was not available the first two times I called and no one else could take the order. Then, when I did place the order and told them we are tax exempt, he still quoted me a price with tax. Not realizing that he included tax, I told him it was a bit high compared to what I expected. He offered to give me a discount and brought the price down 10%. I was appreciative for that since we are a non-profit and have to keep our costs down. \\nWell, when I arrived to pick up the order, I asked for a receipt showing what I paid for and they could not provide me with one because of the discount. During this discussion, I discovered that my 10% discount was applied to the total INCLUDING tax! So he really gave me a 2% discount since we don't pay tax to begin with. The man who was there (Surprise, the manager was not there again) was very nice and tried to help me. He called the manager on the phone so he could figure out how to give me the receipt I needed, but the manager was very rude. When I explained the situation and what I needed, he said he couldn't do it because the register doesn't allow him to. His best offer was to charge me full price so that I could have a receipt that matched the credit card slip. \\nWhen I got the order back to the office and began serving to our clients, we were not pleased. The order was chicken breast kabobs, rice, salad, and pita bread. The chicken was dry, the salad was just chopped iceberg lettuce, and the pita was cold and some pieces were moldy. The only thing I can compliment them on is the flavor of the rice. \\nThey charged me for 30 individual meals, and fortunately, we had a few cancellations because they did not provide enough chicken to feed 30 people. I agreed to allow them to provide the food in catering trays rather than box up 30 meals, but all this allowed them to do was short us. \\nThis was not the first time we had ordered from them, but it will be the last after the treatment I received and the frustration of the whole experience.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Text: I love Jamba Juice.

Although a backdrop was used, in many of the photograph the studio itself was exposed. In other words the backdrop did not cover the entire backgrounds. Many of the photos had at least one member of our party cut off! Eventually we did settle on a package provided some editing and photoshopping be done. We were told it would take 15 minutes before our photos were ready. We came back an hour later and they still weren't ready.

Scanned their menu and decided this was were I was going to satisfy that hunger in me.  The menu is short but they seem to cover a fair amount of area when it comes to quick bites.  I was going back and forth between the gourmet grilled cheese and the Brilloburger.  Of course, being the burger fan I am I opted for the Brilloburger.  I was quite excited because you got to pick the cheese you wanted on it (at no extra cost).  You also get the option to have either potato chips or a mixed green salad, I opted for the mixed green salad.\\n\\nWhen the burger came out, my jaw dropped.  Good thing it did, because is was huge.  So huge it was necessary to cut it in half to devour it.  I swear they make their own buns there, if not they get them locally and fresh daily.  They lightly toast the bun before loading it with that amazing patty of beef.  The burger had to have been a half pounder, juicy and thick (cooked to order).  Lettuce, tomato and red onions top it.  I opted for the smoked Gouda cheese which gave it that extra flavor of goodness.  Thank god for the extra napkins supplied, they were definitely needed.  I'm sure I wasn't a pretty sight eating this monster, but it tasted so good that afterward I swear I should have taken a shower.\\n\\nThe mixed green salad was an amazing side.

You either have to park two blocks down, or pay $5 to park in Vincent's lot. No exceptions if you are a paying customer of Vincent's...you've still got to pay for the opportunity and privilege (!) of walking in their door to buy something. I've never seen a business take that stance before. It's not about the $5...it's about the experience of not seeing the \\\"pay to park\\\" sign (honest mistake!) and then getting chased down by the parking lot guy to pay him NOW or ELSE. Even if it was just 25 cents to park, I would have still moved my car, to not give more money than necessary to a place with such weird business practices.\\n\\nIf I had been going there by myself, I would have just called it a day and gone someplace else. I wouldn't have even bothered with a Yelp review, either. BUT... I was meeting up with a group of people and didn't want to miss out on seeing them, so I ended up becoming one of Vincent's customers that day. The combination of being accosted in the parking lot and moving my car two blocks down to just walk right back again, plus the disappointing atmosphere and food quality prompted me to actually get on Yelp for this.\\n\\nI had heard good things about this place and so skipped my usual breakfast in order to brunch here. I was starving. I looked for the least expensive thing I could find (yes, I was still disgruntled about being yelled at in the parking lot, and didn't want to spend too much at this place). Despite being ravenous, I thought the pastry I bought was just kind of OK...and doesn't food usually taste 10x better when you're really hungry?? But it was just.....fine. So I paid $9 for a so-so pastry and an OK cup of coffee. If I wanted to pay $9 for over-hyped mediocrity, I would've gone to Starbucks. And Starbucks wouldn't have kicked me out of their parking lot. \\n\\nAnyway, I suppose if my expectations had been a little lower, and I had know about the parking situation beforehand, it might not have been such a disappointing experience.

I was sorely disappointed. First, during Yelp's Brunchy Munchy, I thought my pancakes with bacon tasted ok but were quite overpriced for two itsy bitsy pancakes and a lack of friendliness on the part of the staff. The restaurant was attractively decorated and they did accommodate our large group, but without much grace as many others really didn't like what they were served.\\n\\nAlthough I really wanted to like the Edinburgh Larder Bistro because of their mission to serve good quality food made from locally-sourced ingredients, I was on the fence after the brunch about whether I liked this place. I wanted to give it a second try, so my boyfriend and I purchased a groupon for a two-course lunch here. Since I work from home and his work is also flexible, we had brought our backpacks with our computers with us so we could work from New Town in the afernoon. When we showed up at our appointed time for our reservation, the staff looked us up and down and led us to the back room (they obviously wanted to hide us in the back!). At our table, the woman looked us up and down again and, after a long pause and looking disdainingly at our bags, said that other customers would be coming in and sitting next to us so could she take our bags to the other room since they would need the space? She could have framed this much more tactfully and asked if she could help us by relieving us of our bags by taking them out of our way!\\n\\nAlthough things had a rocky start, I liked the simple menu of just a few items that were the fresh specialties of the day made from in-season, local ingredients. We both had the mushroom soup to start. The soup was good and better than a run-of-the-mill cream of mushroom soup but it wasn't too special or memorable. Since we had heard about the Larder Bistro's great bread and thought that bread would be the perfect addition to our starter, we were a bit sad that we weren't served any. Later, during our main course, we were frustrated to see other customers were served bread with their soup while we had not been!\\n\\nFor my main, I had the fish. While I was expecting a flavourful, locally-caught fish, I was underwhelmed by the dish. Although it scored high on presentation and looked quite pretty, it's taste wasn't on the same calibre. To make things worse, when I was over half-way through my meal I found a hair in my dish. I didn't think it was mine but then again I wasn't quite sure. I ate a bit more from other parts of my plate but that was the not-so-perfect end to our lunch.\\n\\nEven though the Larder Bistro might had wanted more posh customers and we didn't seem to meet their expectations, they should have treated us just as well as the other customers (the two older ladies sitting a few tables away, or the couple sitting behind us -- and, no, there was still no one actually sitting at either of the tables next to us!). The other customers were welcomed warmly, had their coats kindly taken out of their way and received bread with their soup. We aren't slobs and we were a bit taken aback by the poor service and underwhelming lunch after hearing such lovely reviews prior to our visits here.

I got a Restaurant.com coupon, and was totally craving some good Italian food, but I'm also a big fan of Japanese food so this combination of Italian-Japanese sounded great.  The location was okay, though a bit hard to find.  The place was well-decorated, as you'd expect for a Japanese place, and the waitress was nice, though not particularly energetic nor friendly.  \\n\\nThe menu was interesting.  Since I wanted to try their uniqueness, and not where they're the same as any other Japanese place, I wanted to focus on the pasta.  We ordered a chicken pasta with Japanese mushrooms, along with a salisbury steak made of beef and kurobuta pork.  For an appetizer, we had the calamari tempura, and dessert was a gelato with Kinako and black honey.  Here's each in turn:\\n\\nCalamari Tempura:  Nothing special, despite being on the specials menu.  It was exactly what it says:  Deep-friend pieces of squid (Japanese cut) with breading.  \\n\\nChicken with Japanese mushrooms:  Weird.  Basically it was a spaghetti in a broth, with a few pieces of chicken and some mushrooms in it.  I can't really describe the taste, aside from it being fairly bland and a bit salty.  It didn't seem like the mushrooms added much to the flavor, and all together seemed like a thrown together mish-mash.  \\n\\nBeef and Kurobuta Pork Salisburg Steak:  Entirely mediocre.  It's just a Salisbury steak.  This one came with a salad, two slices of orange, a sprig of broccoli, and small pasta birdsnest.  The cold pasta thing was really good, actually.  Saved the dish from being entirely forgettable.\\n\\nGelato with Kinako and Black Honey:  This was pretty good.  Seemed like a sweet cream gelato with a bittersweet honey and kinako crumbs, which added nothing almost to the flavor, but was a good choice for some texture to what would otherwise have been plain ice cream.  \\n\\nOverall, the service was a bit a slow, and not very friendly, but not rude.

From a huge of list of celebrated chefs and their restaurants to choose from in Vegas, Sage made it to our list of places to dine. No, regrets whatsoever. In fact, we walked out as happy and very satisfied diners.\\n\\nI tried their 4-course Signature Tasting Menu and my husband went with the ala carte options. The wonderful thing about it is that the entire table doesn't have to do the tasting menu. Phew. However, if you want to do the 10-course menu then the entire table needs to also do it because of the complexity of trying to coordinate everyone's meals.\\n\\nFor the 4-course Signature Tasting Menu, you get to choose between options for each course. I chose the market oysters for my first course and to my surprise, I was given FIVE oysters! Woah! I love raw oysters on the shell so that was a great plus. Then I had the seared scallops which was also very good. The beef belly was the star of the tasting menu. It was so soft it literally melted in my mouth. Ended the tasting menu with profiteroles for dessert which was so good.\\n\\nAs for the ala carte menu which my husband went with, he had roasted sweetbreads which he was very happy about. I tried a piece and the soft texture was amazing. He had the hanger steak and it was prepared to perfection just as he requested: rare.\\n\\nService was also professional and attentive. Our server gave us a reasonable amount of time in between getting seated, ordering drinks, then food and also came to check in on us without overdoing it.\\n\\nSage is easily one of the top restaurants in Vegas.\\n\\nNote to Chicagoans: I asked our server about Chef Shawn McClain and apparently he has plans to gradually close his restaurant businesses in Chicago to focus fulltime in his Las Vegas venture.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Text: I was set to try a burrito and all the flavored fries....uh yeah they don't make them anymore. \\n\\nThey restructured their menu and it now includes only:\\n\\nTacos: beef, chicken, pork or tofu&egg,-  1- $2.78 or 2-$4.63\\n(not so) Fries- seasoned fries $1.16 so no more flavor options\\nCrazy Dough $1.16\\nJumbo \\\"Nate\\\" Dog $2.78\\n12 oz Drinks $1\\n\\nWe got for ourselves, mom and grandma to share 4 pork tacos, 2 tofu&egg, 2 (not so) fries, and 2 crazy doughs. \\n\\nI'm going to be the first somewhat negative review, but seriously I came here excited for some \\\"Seoul\\\" Fusion tacos and it came up short. Let me preface that I am from LA and have been eating my way through all the fusion food trucks when the craze started. You can say that I've had the standard, the grail to which I will judge all others heavily. Oh, and I know how to pickle, brine and kimchee with the best of them and I have done fusion tacos all my life being part of a blended family (filipino adobo tacos, ethiopian tibbs tacos, duck confit tacos, \\\"bahn mi\\\" tacos, BBQ pulled pork and beer slaw...yeah I go there with my food). \\n\\nEven if I didn't have \\\"experience\\\" in this food genre, there was something off about the food. Not trying to be the \\\"expert\\\" asshole, but just saying, I know what kimchee should be like and what is good fusion since that is my style of cooking. Though the kimchee had a right amount of spice to set off the food but not  be overwhelming for meek palettes, the flavor was off and was going in a sort've bitterish, weird flavor that threw off all of us. That is my main shtick is the fusion part of the taco was not good- that is not how kimchee is supposed to be. It can be savory, a bit sour, a bit salty/briny, but bitterish and odd flavor I can't place is a no go. Best way I can describe it is if you were to botch up or have a spoiled batch of kimchee. I had a bad jar once and later found it wasn't not only sealed loosely, but my dad ate pieces out of it with the spoon he was eating lunch with contaminating it hence the off fermented spoilt flavor. So the tacos are fairly big flour tortillas but it was mostly filled with lettuce. The pork was cubes, not the usual shredded, and was soft and juicy and nice on their own, but sparse. The Tofu Egg had a lot of tofu egg in the taco compared to the pork.. It was mashed tofu mixed with the egg and with the very wet kimchee made for a soggy texture that just wasn't working for me. Also, the wetness made it a bitchfit to even eat the tacos because they were stuck to the paper container and ripped holes into my taco so it was then a \\\"bowl\\\" instead of a taco. I think it needs a \\\"heavier\\\" fry to stand up to the wetness of the kimchee (I personally would do crispy/fried tofu cubes and shredded omelette instead of blended together) or drain the kimchee a bit better before putting on the taco to avoid a large amount of the sog factor. The BF left this Tofu&Egg alone after a few bites and that guy kept saying \\\"I'm soo hungry\\\" in the car after we decided to skip \\\"lunch\\\" at 1, go to errands and go eat later here at 4. Apparently not hungry enough to down his taco. \\n\\nFries were yummy- crispy, not greasy and a good amount of seasoning on them. Crazy dough was good- it was crispy and doughy and not greasy at all, but it definitely needed more sugar coating on it (I dipped them in honey at home). \\n\\nI think Vegas needs street food since every great city has great street vendors so I give kudos to anyone who wants to get into the food stand/truck culture and start this city off. For that, I gave it a very fair 3 stars (being VERY nice) and for the fact that my fries and dough were tasty. However, I can't just live off dough and fries alone as a meal and I'm afraid as the way the cards fall that's all I'll be ordering and only if I'm at Lee's already feeling like having a snack. They were doing some sort of promotional stuff at Lees and even had a Hanshik raffle so very well an \\\"event\\\" can boggle things up.  I will come back maybe in a few months and try one taco again to give it a fair chance, but as it stands it's something I hesitate ordering again. The BF does not want to go back, he says he was really disappointed.\\n\\n I was set to go to Blue Nile Ethiopian food for lunch, Crown bakery for dessert  and dinner at the Slider Truck then the BF got the idea to go to this instead to bring to his mom and grandma food who weren't feeling to well. Yeah, today I feel I got shafted out of a good eating day at three places to go to one place that didn't live to the hype....I was pretty pissed I starved part of the day to eat w/ the family instead at a place near them. I have to resurrect it myself by getting in my kitchen late tonight and doing up something Chef worthy. It might have been an off day for them and everyone can have that, but shit it made my seeming good day off. It wasn't their fault we chose to come at that day and time, but we expected something worth giving up my day for and that leaves me bitter as the kimchee.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Text: This review was for 7/17/2011.

I was there to drop off two trash bags full of donation clothing.  While I was there, my teenage son wanted to look around.  I found an XBox360 for sale for $70 and a jacket for $10 that I decided to purchase.  I was not familiar with their policies because I have not shopped there before but have rather just donated.  So I asked the cashier about the XBOX and if it worked or not.  She said she didn't know so I asked if I bought it and it didn't work if I could return it.  She said that was no problem and I said, okay, well, I guess I have nothing to lose as long as I can bring it back if it doesn't work and return it for my money back --- I mean,come on, its an XBOX for $70, I figured it didn't work but thought, \\\"what the heck, If I can bring it back, why not?\\\".  The cashier, Jamie made me feel like it was safe to try.  I took it home and found that it did not work.  I took it back within one hour of purchasing it.  I was told by Ruth that they could only give me store credit.  I told her that Jamie had told me that I could get my money back if it didn't work.  Ruth told me that I should have been aware of their policy because it is posted in the store on a poster hanging above the entrance and on my receipt.  However, I would not have seen this unless I looked up or had already purchased it in order to have the receipt.  At that time, Jamie walked past me and I asked her why she had told me I could return it for my money back.  She said that she thought I could.  So I asked Ruth why, if an employee didn't know the policy, that I was expected to know it?  I told Ruth that I would like to speak to a manager.  She said that there wasn't one available and she would have them call me.  I asked when that would be and she didn't know.  I said, well should I just leave the purchases there and then decline the charges with my credit card.  She said what ever I did was up to me and was very rude.  I said that since she wasn't giving me any options I would just leave everything with her (including the jacket because I was going to try to get my money back from the credit card company).  So I left everything with her because I told her I would be contacting my card company to dispute the charge.  So I took a video of all the merchandise and Ruth taking it and making a note of it on the receipt (which she kept).  \\n\\nOne week later, Ruth called me to tell me she couldn't get her district manager to deal with the issue, nor to even call me.  She told me she could not give me his name or his phone number.  And that I would just need to deal with my credit card company with my issues.  \\n\\nMy credit card company denied the dispute because I had nothing in writing - my video was not suitable proof.  \\n\\nBefore writing this review I called and spoke with Ruth one last time to ask if I could please speak with the district manager because I planned to file a complaint with the BBB (WHICH BUYER BEWARE, THEY ARE NOT MEMBERS) if it could not be resolved.  She said he was on vacation.  And although she was unwilling to give her district manager's name or phone number.  She did tell me that she was given another district manager as their contact person while her manager is on vacation, whom I also wasn't able to reach (surprise, surprise) . \\n\\nHere are the key issues that I feel warrant this review and my claim to the BBB.  \\n#1) The fact is that I have spent $80 in a store and have no product(s) or services to show for it.   However, I do have a video showing me leaving everything with Ruth and vocalized everything happening in the video\\n#2)  The employee, Jamie TOLD me that I could return the XBOX if it didn't work for my money back and they should honor what they said.  Especially since I have been a great donator to this location.  It is very close to my house and I bring all of my children's outgrown clothes and toys as donations.  The irony of it all is that I actually donated more that $80 worth of items on the day that this horrendous customer service experience occurred.\\n#3)  The policy to only give back store credit, while posted in an area of the store - was not well known, because even their own employee was not aware of it.  Also, having it printed on the receipt is illogical because you don't get a receipt until the transaction is already done.  I don't think that my first trip purchasing something in the store should make me more aware of this policy than a store employee knows.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Text: I dropped off a deer on Dec 8.

I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.\\n\\nAnd I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \\\"what's going on here\\\" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.\\n\\nFinally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.\\n\\nMy first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \\\"Uh-oh\\\".  The menu is huge with a number of \\\"slow-food\\\" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.\\n\\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  \\n\\nSadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.\\n\\nMy sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \\\"bacon\\\" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \\\"meat\\\".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  \\n\\nMax's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \\\"The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\\\".\\n\\nThat's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.\\n\\nIf you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.  \\n\\nI'll never return.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Text: Let me start by warning you it's VERY over priced.

The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious, the cornbread sweet but well made, and the coleslaw was good too (not too smothered in mayo). I wasn't a fan of the matchstick fries, but that's just me.\\n\\nOthers at my table also really enjoyed their food and overall experience.\\n\\nOnce we finished dinner, we asked to see a dessert menu and were approached maybe 5 times by our server asking if we had made a decision. This was a little bit annoying because he was hovering but even then, I wasn't mentally taking any stars away from my review. We ordered the apple pie ice cream sandwich to share which was also very very well made.\\n\\nBy that point, we had been at the diner for about two hours to 2.5 hours and had been chatting as most people do (9:30pm on a Thursday). We paid around that time also and proceeded to continue our conversation. Around 10, the manager came to our table pretty much kicking us out saying that she had reserved our table for another couple who had been waiting over 35 minutes for us to leave, and that she could seat us in a corner (our booth had access to the TV) because they wanted to watch the game, or we could just leave.\\n\\nNow you can imagine our disdain....no one had said anything to us about our table being reserved. We were paying customers who didn't really overstay their welcome in terms of going out for dinner, drinks, and dessert. And you can't just kick people out because they've paid their bill and now someone else wants our particular table (which was nothing special by the way).\\n\\nSo, as you can imagine, the three of us left with a very bad taste in our mouths, and although I was really excited to bring other friends and family to try out the food here, it's safe to say that I will definitely not be back.

No worries there, that was ok with us after a long day. \\n\\nWe ordered spanakopita as an appetizer, he ordered a gyro with no tomatoes and french fries, and I ordered the beef souvlaki sandwitch with Greek salad. \\n\\nLet me preface the food review with this: I LOVE food. I love going out to eat. I'm very forgiving of mistakes, and kind when I correct them. Out of my 56 Yelp reviews, only 4 have received 1 star, and all for a very legitimate reason. I really go out of my way to give places ample opportunities to correct my frustrations, and few places are lacking in their ability to make me happy. That said, on to the food. \\n\\nSpanakopita: It took awhile to come out, and it was not terribly appetizing to look at. The two pieces were drastically different in size, but that wasn't the worst part. The spanakopita was luke warm/cold, tasted like it came from the frozen food aisle or had been sitting out for weeks. It was bland, not at all flaky, and the texture was really weird. Oh, and the tzatziki sauce was the worst I've ever tasted, including the months past due grocery store kind that I kept in my fridge as a poor college student. The waitress didn't bother to come back and ask how it was.\\n\\nGyro with fries: The meat was flavorless, cold, and smothered in tomatoes (he specifically said to leave them out) and that terrible tzatziki sauce. The fries were cold and awful. HOW do you mess up fries???\\n\\nBeef souvlaki with salad: The beef was tougher than shoe leather, and the leather would have had more flavor. The tzatziki (yes, I'm saying it AGAIN just to emphasize) was TERRIBLE. Oh, and the salad. If you could even call it that.

The plates were thrown together like they didn't care, and the service was sub par.\\n\\nThe WORST Part: The waitress saw us not eating, came over and asked how dinner was. I politely said it was terrible, and started listing off our grievances. Then a woman, who was apparently the \\\"boss lady\\\" came over to see what was wrong. I've never been so insulted in my life. When my bf said that the gyro meat was cold and bland, she said \\\"well they cut it off the rotisserie and put it on the grill\\\". He politely told her that he knew that's how it worked, but that it wasn't hot. She said \\\"Well, that doesn't make any sense. We're known for the best gyros in town, and we have 4 & 5 star reviews on Yelp\\\". Ok so we're totally making all this up, then. *scoff* She said \\\"sorry\\\" and walked away. No offer to replace the food, or take a portion off our bill. \\n\\nSo we paid $22 for food we said was terrible, with nothing but a condescending apology to walk out of the door with. FYI, we paid for our food (we regret refusing to do so), and left all but 2 bites of each dinner on the table. \\n\\nI'd give the place another chance if the food were the only bad thing.

Typical to an Indian lunch buffet, the fresh-baked naan and roti are complimentary, but the whole wheat roti is especially good here - one would expect it to come out traditionally thin and flat, but the Mt. Everest version can be mistaken for a puffy naan bread - a nice surprise. Whole wheat roti has taken the place of white basmati rice in my Indian lunch diet.\\n\\nBuffet plates and bowls are clean and shiny. Water glasses are refilled constantly, every single visit. Finished plates are picked up quickly. Overall service is great. My only warning is you may smell like Indian food for the rest of the afternoon, so if you are on your way to an important meeting in a small office space, maybe bring a change of clothing if you are self-conscious about that kind of thing. I guess this is proof that when you eat the lunch buffet at Mt. Everest, you are immersed in a cauldron of Indian deliciousness.\\n\\nGo now and get it while it's hot!

I am one of those that LOVE education, sitting in classroom, learning and growing. I went through the websites hundreds of times dreaming of completing multiple programs. I already have a career that I love so the classes for me was more of personal growth and professional development and not necessarily looking to start from scratch in a new career. \\n\\nI work with Veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder in a clinical and case management setting. When I saw the workshop on how to teach yoga for veterans and others with PTSD I felt it was a good fit. I was always interested in teaching yoga to my current clientele and felt that this course would be the perfect fit for me.  I was extremely disappointed. I completed the course feeling upset, hurt and angry. What was being taught in class went blatantly against 'best practices' that had been outlined by the nation's leading trauma experts (Dr. Bessel van der kolk, Judith Herman, Peter Levine) and in certain cases what was taught could cause a lot of harm to a population that is already hurting. \\n\\nBeing a class about trauma the instructor didn't even touch on the most common reason for trauma for Veterans or even for the general population. When I brought it up he was like \\\"what is that?\\\" During break out group sessions my classmates were asking me loads of questions often saying that I sound more like i \\\"knew what I was talking about\\\" than the instructor.  Sad.\\n\\nI ended up completing an EXCELLENT program in Massachusetts. I showed several of my classmates the course material from SWIHA and they were in disbelief of what was being taught as compared to what we were learning at the school in Massachusetts. \\n\\nIt was just one class and I can't base an entire school off one teacher so I started looking into the Aromatherapy certification. This is a certification that I want for no other reason other than personal growth. What can I say? I LOVE learning. I was about to sign up for it when instead I decided to check out its credentials. Aromatherapy is a self regulated field represented by two organizations in the United States, the National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA) and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists (AIA). Neither of those organizations listed SWIHA as an approved school. Well there goes that plan to take aromatherapy classes at SWIHA. Thank goodness I didn't pay for it yet!\\n\\nI spoken to many students at the school and the information given to them by the school of what the program is truly about is not exactly the case. I have spoken to a handful that were told that the 800-hours Teaching Training Program is to directly lead you to becoming a yoga therapist. SWIHA website even states \\\"800 Hour Yoga Teacher Training / Yoga Therapist\\\"  Sadly, that is NOT the case. SWIHA is not approved by the International Associations of Yoga Therapy (IAYT).\\n\\nI have been warned by many in the community about this school---several of my yoga teachers in the community told me not to attend because of its reputation. I should have believed them from the start.\\n\\nI removed SWIHA's website from my favorites. I won't take their catalog next time I am shopping at Whole Foods.

The chowders are excellent, as is the Caesar salad.  \\n\\nBut the thing that ties the whole thing together is their bread, which is kind of toasty and soft and chewy all at the same time, and which is perfect for extracting every last bite of sauce and crab bits from the last remnants of your pan roast.

I was recommended to try this as a nice out door activity. I rented bikes through the Madison B Cycle program; fortunately, there was a pick up location near my hotel. I enjoyed the bike path when I first started. There were many other bikers and runners on the path. However, the smell of the lake was a little pungent. It was a nice scenery, the background was very green with all the trees surrounding the water. There were wake surfers and people kayaking on the lake, which had a nice family feeling to it. I was told that the bike path around the lake is approximately 13 miles. As I was riding, I noticed that the paths started to split. I followed other bikers, but lost them because I couldn't catch up (the rented bikes were single speed compared to the actual professional cyclists). About half way through, I noticed I was no longer following a bike path. Instead, I was riding through residential streets, including 2 very steep hills (not easy on a single speed bike). I was pretty much lost for an hour, riding around the streets. Unfortunately, I was running out of cellular service, too (t-mobile needs to extend their services out there). Without any way of finding a map, I used the lake as a guide. I knew I'd end up where I started and won't be lost if I can see the lake. Soon enough, I made it back safely. I'm giving this 3 stars because the paths were a little misleading. I would recommend this to anyone who is traveling with a partner.

Many of the rooms here have doors with defects that don't close unless you pull extremely hard. Even if you hear the door slam, double check to see if the door has closed all the way!

I just recently went to see Nile at LVCS. \\n\\nThe stage at LVCS is small but allows for a more intimate experience with bands. The drinks are expensive,  but are on par with the prices you'd pay at the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay or the Pearl at the Palms. There was a promoter who was passing out 2 for 1 drink passes that we were able to use at the bar inside the venue. Since my husband and I are accustomed to paying $10+ for a beer at concerts, we were pretty stoked we could catch a break for once. The bartender was awesome!

We were not picky and we were attracted to the different promos going on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It has three floors, the basement which is considered a club (in all honesty, they shouldn't), the second floor is a nice bar with a live band (usually) and the third floor is Karinas (always empty but a good spot to rent for private events). Needless to say that the spot I usually go to is on the second floor: they don't have a cover on weekends and they have a much better terrace than the basement. The band I usually get when I go is pretty good and the feeling of the place is very casual. It has the same feeling as a McGibbons or an Irish Pub. Winston Churchil gets a 3 stars for the atmosphere. \\n\\nDrinks & Food\\n\\nI am not a big fan of the drinks served at Winston Churchill. Besides their Sangria, every drink that is not a beer was poorly done. The only positive point that Winston Churchill has over other bars is that it is cheaper. On Tuesdays they have a special which is $2.50 for the drink and $4 the beer, which in my opinion, is a great deal. The food aspect of this place is as you would expect bar food to be (typical nachos and fries) however what is interesting with this place is that the food is not the same from one floor to another (probably because the vibe of the floors are different: the basement being a ''club'' and the second floor being a bar with a pub feel to it). This Montreal bar gets a 2 stars for its drinks.\\n\\nService\\n\\nThe service on the terrace is usually really bad, with the exception of one or two good waitresses. I don't think I have ever got so much attitude coming from a waitress before. However, if you decide to stay inside on the basement level, I would go ask for a bartender called Valerie. She is very nice and talkative and will make sure you have a good night. The service of this Montreal bar gets 2 stars.  \\n\\nLocation\\n\\nThe location of Winston Churchill is particularly good during the summer considering it is located on Crescent street (it's awesome during the Grand Prix weekend) and awesome for when you go to school downtown. Its proximity to metro Guy Concordia makes it really easy to access as well. For all these reasons, Winston Churchill gets 4 stars for its location.\\n\\nThe total amount of stars I would allocate to Winston Churchill in general would be 3.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Text: This was the former location of Scraps 4 Pets. I was saddened and worried a bit when I found out about a change in ownership. I was loyal, I felt comfortable with those who ran Scraps.  Rest assured that those who did go to Scraps will be happy with the boutique that has replaced it. Much has changed, but I feel these have been good changes.\\n\\nThe shop has moved a few suites down to make room for a self wash, bakery goods and the usual foods, treats and accessories. I didn't get pictures for the profile, but will on my next stop. It's triple the size of the old one. \\n\\nObviously other than the food, I was drawn in as a customer to Scraps for the friendly and approachable staff. The new staff is just as nice and talkative so I feel good about coming to this place. One of the girls has the most mellow and sweetest frenchie/boston as the stores new resident doggy that rounds out the welcoming feel of the store. \\n\\n The prices are about the same and reasonable (not huge markups on foods- shipping some \\\"cheaper\\\" items online will still cost me more in total than driving down here) and selection is good. Hopefully with this change, the selection might even get better. I took a trip to their SW location and there's a lot more variety than Scraps had and more than this location currently stocks. Variety is a plus to me since I like to rotate foods and treats to keep the animals interests up (and keep food allergies from happening). The only new \\\"must have\\\" treat I have to go to the SW location folr are Merricks hooves since these little pugs need big dog sized challenging chews. All of the basic foods and  treats for the dogs and cat I can find here. \\n\\nThe bakery goods are a welcomed addition. The dogs love the parmesan bacon muffins (75 cents each) the best but enjoyed all the cookies we have brought home and the cat ended up liking the cheese cookies (75 cents each) the best crumbled up into bite size pieces. \\n\\nThe dog wash in the back seems stocked well and kept clean. I saw a sign that it is $9 for any sized dog which is cheaper than a lot of places I've seen. I nearly pulled my back trying to wash my dogs in my little ass stand up shower so it's something to consider. \\n\\nThe business/staff are associated with a rescue; the owners also run Heaven Can Wait Sanctuary and many of the staff are volunteers and fosters. That makes me happy since it's basically full circle of helping out animals: they help them find homes, aid with population issues by offering low cost spaying&neuter clinics, help with feral cat populations, then providing a place for those owners to get good foods and services to keep animals happy in their new homes.\\n\\nAnother plus is that they're open 7 days a week. Weekends are our only time to be able to shop for the animals together and sometimes it was difficult to come on Saturdays and  Sundays were closed. \\n\\nI'm a big fan of local business in general but I'm very enthusiastic about this place since it enables me to be the kind of pet parent I want to be.

Revisiting the past again.  I actually ate at Firefly for the first time years ago when my wife and I were visiting with our friends and were guided here by an old high school friend that lives in LV now.  Prior to eating at Firefly, my wife and I had never had Tapas.  Being in town for CES last weekend with the same friends that came the first time, they requested to revisit Firefly for a dinner and we obliged.\\n\\nWhen my wife found out that they wanted to come back, she had a feeling of discomfort associated with the restaurant that should couldn't really place the reason behind at the time.  But as soon as we walked in, it came back to her; she didn't like sitting at the lounge table.  For those of you who have not been before, be aware that there is a bar, a set of normal tables with chairs and booth seats, and then a number of tables surround by low couches that require leaning over a lot to eat.  We requested a normal dining table this time to appease her, and it made all the difference.\\n\\nWhen we arrived on Thursday night after our first day at CES, it was already pretty hopping.  We put our names down for a table and went to the bar.  I remembered having the Sangria last time, but didn't remember how good it was.  I asked the bar tender if I could try the red wine Sangria (effectively ordering it), but then he actually made a mini version of the drink with fruit bits and all for me to try it.  I then asked to try the white and champagne Sangrias (meeting more and more resistance each time, understandably) before ordering the champagne version.  The fact that he was wiling to let me sample all three was greatly appreciated.  Great bar tender.  My wife ordered a Mojito (so-so), and then a couple caramel apple martinis because they blew her away.  Highly recommended.\\n\\nSoon we were told a table was available for us and we sat at a comfortable, standard table.  Here is what we ordered (that I can recall) and our impressions:\\n\\nShrimp ceviche - Nice shrimp, but way too citrusy (sour).\\n\\nStuffed dates - A great blend of sweet and savory (dates + bacon).\\n\\nFrench Fries - A great filler. Shoestring with Parmesan and herbs. Ask for aioli to dip in.\\n\\nManchego Mac 'n Cheese - A favorite for my wife (the mac 'n cheese connoisseur).  Very good and cheesy.\\n\\nTerra y Mare Skewers - Tasty and good quality filet, shrimp, and chorizo.\\n\\nChicken and Chorizo stuffed mushrooms - Sizzling awesomeness.  They're hot when they first come out, so be careful.\\n\\nLamb skewers - Very good and tender.\\n\\nFried calamari - I don't like squid, so I didn't really partake, but the other three said it was very good.\\n\\nCamarones a la diabla - Shrimp with a nice kick and a smoky sauce.  Good stuff.\\n\\nChocolate Tres Leches Cake - Amazing! Melts in your mouth. No chewing necessary.  Super soft and moist.  Drooling...\\n\\nWith the 10 entrees and multiple rounds of drinks, you'd think the bill would be nuts, but it was around $150 total, which is perfectly reasonable for 4 people given the quality, variety, and quantity.  I recommend you check this place out if you want a great tapas experience.  There's a nice cigar bar in the same strip mall, too.\\n\\nSummary: Great food. Very reasonable prices.  High quality.  Full bar.  Lots of parking.  Place gets hopping at night, so come early or plan for a wait.  Great bar service and drinks.  Lounge seating and normal tables.  Lounge seats require leaning forward a lot.  Highly recommended restaurant.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Text: There's a reason Troy has this kind of stellar rating across the board.

Steep prices are met by skimpy amounts of fish.  The only normal sized item we were served was the salmon sashimi.  One of our appetizers was yellowtail, and for $18 we were served 6 tiny slivers of tuna.  The rolls, while I particularly enjoyed that they were the perfect bite sized amounts and looked pretty when it was served, primarily consisted of rice.  Sorry, but a mouthful of rice is not what I'm looking for when spending $15+ on a roll.  I'd actually like to have SOME fish in the roll.

By the way, you order at the walk-up counter. \\n\\nWe got our drinks and sat down. The food came out really fast! The pancakes for my partner were going to take a bit they said, which was no problem. About two minutes later, a man told us they had to make the batter for the pancakes so it was just going to be a bit longer and asked if we'd like some biscuits while we waited. We said sure, and he brought out two small, hot biscuits. THEY WERE DELICIOUS! And surprisingly really filling! He also brought some strawberry jam too. I don't even LIKE jam and I thought it was so good! And seriously 5 minutes later they brought out the pancakes. Not a big deal at all to wait at most 5-7 minutes for a side when your main meal is already out. But to bring some complimentary and delicious biscuits? EXCELLENT customer service and attentiveness all the way around. \\n\\nThe chicken fried steak was really good and had some great flavor. The sauce especially had some nice seasoning to it. The hash browns were browned and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I personally would have liked them a bit more done, but it was no problem and really could be the difference of being cooked 30 more seconds. So, consider that my petty personal preference. Since I've never had eggs benedict before, I have nothing to gage my judgement against. So take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt: the first few bites were good. But after awhile, everything was a bit too soft and a bit too bland, even with salt and pepper. It makes sense; you have a smooth sauce, a poached egg (also my first one), a soft avocado, soft tomato slice, and an English muffin (evenly sliced and while warm, not toasted that I could tell.)  That's a lot of soft food with mellow flavors all at once. Not my favorite, but I could see how someone else would like it. Like I said, since it was my first one, I have nothing to compare. I ate about 1/2 of it, and since I had hash browns and that biscuit, you can see how I was full! Considering the chicken fried steak was delicious, I think it's just my preference that I didn't care for the eggs benedict.

She complained about the lack of red velvet cake chunks, but I thought the whole thing was delicious. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I helped her finish the sundae after myself downing the frozen espresso (essentially a big chunk of coffee ice cream drowned in chilled espresso) and the apple pie waffles.

We were in in less than 5 mins. \\n\\nWe got in and WOW this place is pretty big and nice. Love the lights on the ceiling! Like always we jetted to the bar. I was in a Ciroc mood so I asked for the Red Berry with Sprite...only to find out that it was open bar for Belvedere! So F the Ciroc, I'm going for the free ish! It was about 30 mins left for open bar, so of course I drank like no other in that time span. \\n\\nIt was around 12:30 and the crowd got packed. They played house all night.

It was a brand new, never worn Invicta, worth about only $200. But it was given to me by my uncle right before he passed away, so it has more sentimental value than monetary value. I just moved here to the Summerlin area not too long ago, so I figured that bringing it to the closest place that can give me a new battery would be a good idea. This place was also the location we purchased my dad's Father's Day gift and moms birthday gift from. They have nothing but Rolex, Breitling, Tacori and other high valued jewelry so one would assume they would know what they're doing. But as the phrase goes, \\\"never judge a book by its cover\\\"... When I first brought it in the lady at the counter said it would only take a couple of minutes, but then the repair technician said it would take about an hour because the back would not come off. So I left, called 3 hours later to make sure it was ready before I went over there, the lady who answered said it wouldn't be ready until tomorrow at the earliest, but we'll call you as soon as it's ready. No problem. So then tomorrow comes around, 2pm I just drive over there to pick up my watch whether it's done or not I intended on bringing it home with me. When I get the watch and am looking at it while the lady is ringing me up, first the wristband falls off, no big deal, easy fix, but then I notice a nice size scratch on the watch. I felt it with my finger and it's pretty deep. When I first mentioned it, the lady insisted that it was just the plastic. I inspected it and it was not the plastic. (Let alone, I own several Invicta watches and none have ever had plastic on this area.) I told her this definitely was not the plastic that was scratched. She took it back and had the technician look at it and he said it was the plastic, then with an attitude and confidently said \\\"like I told you, it's obviously the plastic, so is it ok to take the plastic off to show you?\\\"  I told her sure.... Minutes later she came back like a dog with its tail between its legs and said \\\"you're going to have to leave it overnight, it's a scratch\\\". Told me to come back tomorrow and they'll have it ready, \\\"free of charge\\\".  When I came back, of course they went against their word and wanted me to pay, which I did and decided it would be easier to pay the money then to have to deal with them any longer. If they can't properly service a $200 Invicta, I sure wouldn't trust them with my $7,000 Rolex I have from my grandfather. I know you can't please everybody and I'm pretty good about giving places a second chance, but it's safe to say my family will not be coming around to T. Bird Jewelers again.

Why then, might you wonder, am I giving ASU such a low rating?\\n\\nSimple.\\n\\nThe quality of education is lacking at best, and laughable at worst. Granted, my experience is going to be different than someone who majored in the hard sciences, law, business, engineering, or any of Michael Crow's other pet projects. I had the misfortune of dual-majoring in Psychology and Women's Studies, both areas of study that fall under the Liberal Arts. \\n\\nThe University, by the way, refused to confer my Women's Studies degree because the numerous advisers I met with neglected to tell me that I had missed the cutoff deadline by about a semester. So, despite doing all the work and finishing my thesis, I was awarded a minor, alongside an invitation to take fifteen completely unnecessary credits to get my second degree. When translated to cold, hard, cash, that comes out to the tune of ~$9,000. \\n\\nIn the end I decided to forget about the second major - an undergraduate degree in the Liberal Arts from ASU isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Do not take this to mean however, that good professors don't exist - I've met plenty of fantastic professors during my time at ASU, but I also saw a number of them leave, disgusted by Crow's vision for the college. \\n\\nAs an employee, I got to see the ASU that a lot of students don't - I had the opportunity to talk to many professors at staff meet and greets who simply couldn't deal with what they'd come to refer to as \\\"bureaucratic bull****\\\". I've talked to no less than half a dozen professors who left, tired of frustrating tenure requirements, narrow minded research-oriented policies, and uneven allocation of educational funding. So, really, it's not just the students-at-large that are treated like second-class citizens at the university. The teachers present get their fair share of abuse too. \\n\\nIn addition to the education, there are a host of other things wrong with ASU - astronomical parking prices, overemphasis on new dorms, mandatory meal plans (for on-campus students anyway), and terrible student/alumni support, to name a few. \\n\\nMake no mistake about it.

I absolutely loved the atmosphere, with the dim lighting of different chandeliers and the lit bar area. Service was wonderful, as well - friendly and prompt. We decided to follow the advice from Seftel's review and skip the overpriced items like guacamole and tacos, instead focusing on The Mission's more unique dishes. We started off with the absolutely amazing almejas al vapor - clams, rock shrimp, chorizo, and more in a delicate but pungent broth with grilled bread to soak it up with. For entrees, the swordfish veracruz and the scallop dish both were fantastic. The Mission fries - sweet potato and regular - were the best I've had in the Valley, topping the sweet potato fries at Delux. Typically, Latin restaurants disappoint where dessert is involved, but The Mission is an exception - the pumpkin bread pudding with scotch, caramel, pomegranate, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream was WOW-worthy. I hope this place is here for the long-haul, because we could use more unique restaurants that fill an open niche (in this case, haute Latin American).\\n\\nTIP 1: Skip the overpriced guacamole, unless you have a party of 4+, and the tiny-portioned tacos.\\n\\nTIP 2: You might hesitate to order fries at a Latin restaurant, but that would be a mistake.

It was clear they were very understaffed.\\n\\nIf Harvard & Highland stays as popular as it was this past Saturday, they're going to need to hire more help.  Their inability to keep up with the crowd almost certainly cost them money (we ourselves would have ordered more had we the opportunity).  I suspect this will change as H&H figure out when they're going to be the most crowded.\\n\\nIt's important to note that cocktails are the only thing on the menu.  There's a few non-alcoholic seltzer drinks.  I was surprised there wasn't a selection of high-end bourbon or other hard alcohols if you didn't want one of the speciality cocktails.  There's also no food at all (but Union is downstairs if you want to eat beforehand).  \\n\\nThis is a great space with a great bartender and a lot of potential.

We were in a rush to catch a show, so we didn't have time to ask the chef to re-make it or bring out something else, although I'm sure for Thanksgiving, the turkey is already made in batches, and probably over-brined, which means they couldn't make it less salty if they wanted to at that point. \\n\\nI myself ordered the filet mignon off of their regular menu.

We cancelled our reservation with U-Haul (bad mistake) becasue we were supposedly getting a better deal with Budget. Quite frankly it would have been if Tonya (Customer Service Rep at this location)had stuck with the original order. We did not select insurance coverage when making the reservation online because we had already verified with our State Farm Agent (the best one EVER) that we were already covered for the contents and the truck and their beloved Loss of Use. However, a clever little game they seem to have of changing your original reservation (which was a 10' truck) to a 12' truck because suddenly they \\\"didn't have any available 10' trucks\\\", and oops suddenly she couldn't tell I had declined her coverage.  Keeping in mind the reservation was verified the night before pick up and this was not told to us at that time. But this is the kicker, although they gave us the same rental amount, TONYA STACKED AND PACKED INSURANCE ON IT.  By that I mean, she told my daughter  which box to check and where to sign. My daughter asked her what it was and she told my daughter \\\"it is required to protect our truck and you have to have it\\\". This blitz cost us $108.00, which is more than the \\\"break\\\" they gave us on a truck bigger than we wanted, needed or reserved.  Their supposed customer service Manager Jose, called to \\\"get her story\\\" then gets back on the line and tells me that my daughter had an option. Well we all have choices and mine is not only to fight this charge but to make as many people aware as possible of the shady dealings from this office as well as to check with your insurance carrier. Chances are you already pay for enough coverage that you wouldn't need additional. They like to use a scare tactic, especially to younger people it would appear, that your insurance will not cover loss of use and if something happened to take the truck out of commission they would charge your credit/debit card the daily rate for it. Well, that is quite the tactic since not many can afford that to happen. But, like I said CHECK WITH YOUR INSURANCE AGENT first, then insist denial of theirs.  I checked for us ahead of time to ensure our insurance had it covered and Budget still got us.

I can't go too long without some, and strangely enough, it seems to be a rarity near me.  They seem to specialize in Chinese food, but all I was interested in was the Vietnamese.\\n\\nHard to screw up pho for me.  All it needs is the right ingredients and just take a hot minute to get to me.  I'll probably blame the usual clientele for the limited pho selection, but I have also seen worse.  This is the first time I've seen tendon pho all by itself; usually it's along side tripe and other meats.  This could have been very disappointing as I don't typically see a lot of tendon in pho, but no, they were generous here.  On the other hand, for an establishment that prides itself on fresh ingredients (even says so on the menu), their condiments were far from such.  The lime, basil, and sprouts looked far older than I cared to guess.  I drowned them in the hot broth before I decided they might be unappetizing -- except the sprouts as they were just too far gone.  Maybe if they hadn't called so much attention to their ingredients, I would have been more lenient.  Noodles and broth were sufficient in quantity and quality.\\n\\nHere's a little story: I had a tad too much sun earlier that day and was quite burnt.  I know: strange that I would want hot pho after being sunburnt, but I just had to have it.  They had the plus of being an all Asian staff; I almost prefer it when there was a language barrier to overcome -- typically a sign of authenticity.  And I found some of that with the waitress.  Now there was one exchange that I just wasn't understanding, but after a bit of back-and-forth, turns out she was asking me if I was drunk because of my red face.  While funny at the moment, it sadly once again made me think of what kind of clientele they have to put up with to require that kind of question.  At least she was nice about it.  Another interesting note was the television had a soccer game on in Spanish.  This was a first for me in an Asian establishment, and I'll have to be forgiven for asking about it.  Turns out the owner himself likes it and speaks it.  Supposedly the regulars expect nothing less.

She looked like she'd never seen it before and only took $10 off.. Which is what I paid..

I don't think I would be particularly fond of having some stranger sit extremely close to me & have to talk over their conversation to be heard by my dinner companion. \\n\\nWe started off our dinner with cocktails. I had the sparkling negroni containing moscato wine, which was strictly ok. It started off sweet but left a bitter taste at the end. The hubby got the rum cocktail which was nothing to right home about. \\n\\nFor starters we got the beef tartar & the sashimi. I think the sashimi was probably a little more flavorful than the tartar which didn't have too much flavor wise. For our main courses we got the barmundi(seabass) & beef. The barmundj was decent... Other than having some salt,it was pretty flavorless. The shallots were the best part of this dish for me. The beef was well seasoned & perfectly cooked.... The best meal of the night... Though I have eaten better at less steep prices. \\n\\nFor Dessert we got the millionaire's shortbread... Or should I just saythe Salt Ball instead... Coz That's what it was. Salty peanuts & salty pretzels over a salty peanut Carmel base.

After we got the cook to actually get back into the shack and stop chit chatting with the family outside i was thinking maybe i might finally get to eat. $3.50-$4.50 was the average cost of an Arepa across the board but keep in mind when your asked if you want cheese that its an additional .50cents to your total. Ordering a chicken, beef arepa and a bean and cheese empanada. Got my food and it all fit into a medium sized styrofoam container, this was where i asked is this all of it? yup.

But it left me wanting something more to eat because it did not fill me up at all. \\n\\nTo those looking for a tasty bite/snack to hold you off before a dinner or a late night munchie after a little night life in Vegas sure this is the spot. But if your looking to be stuffed after having one $4 arepa id say only if you were a tiny 90ln chick. You need at least two of these to be a complete meal so keep that in mind when ordering. What id like to see is some better seating for the customers so i dont have to go 5 blocks down the road and park my car. And i think the use of maybe a complete meal package... like 2 arepas one chicken one beef and a little rice and beverage for lets say $10? i think this would not only have customers happy but also the owners would sell quite a few of these instead of many ordering just individual as i did when i sampled the offerings.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Text: Service was quick & professional.

Also when the sheet gets pulled down into the stage it looks AMAZING, almost like it's water going down a sink.  To miss that because the sheet is covering you I think cheats you out of that experience.  BTW, if you happen to be at the edge of the sheet-DO NOT HOLD ON TO IT!!!!!

I should start this review by saying I'm a terrible scaredy cat.... So I wasn't sure if there'd be many rides for me. Luckily I was able to enjoy almost all of them! Yes I'm the girl with the blood curdling screams. We arrived around 2pm and it was perfect. The place has a steady stream of people, but not so busy that we had to wait forever in line. We never waited more than fifteen min (End of season perk). Sometimes no line at all. Definitely great to go at this time of year. My friend found out it is half price after 2pm, and I think that is a great deal. Although if you plan to go more than 3 times, you may be better off getting the season pass. \\n\\nMy absolute favorite ride is the half pike. I was originally too scared to ride it, but so glad my friend talked me into it. You go down a short tunnel, and then it feels like the bottom drops out & you fall straight down & immediately up what looks like a skate board wall and back down again. So much fun! This ride requires the combined weight of both riders to be 200. They actually put you on a scale to confirm, but don't worry it is more of a pass/fail rather than actually saying your weight. If the scale shows a green light, you are good to go. \\n\\nMy 2nd favorite ride (and the Bf's fav) was the new Tornado. It can take up to 4 people per ride. This one sends you down a tunnel and then into a giant funnel like 'tornado' sending you back & forth up the funnel sides. Thrilling & awesome! \\n\\nPersonally I also really liked Rattler & Zipp, Zapp, Zoom. rattler is another one that allows 4 people. A fun pink & green twisting & turning slide. The ZZZ is definitely very calm and I was able to build up some confidence. \\n\\nI think it is great that they offer complimentary sun screen. Also all of the staff were incredibly fun & friendly. I really felt like the employees working the rides took time & care to ensure safety, but also keep it fun. \\n\\nMy only concern is pricing. I feel tickets/season passes & etc are all a little high for what is offered. I am sure they plan to add more rides, so I can't wait to see what else they bring. \\n\\nWe went back to the alcohol dining area and I recommend getting the Stella. It tasted so good. Food is on par with what you would expect. Nothing fancy. Chicken fingers were pretty good with quality ranch (some ranch is terrible) and I definitely liked the criss cut fries.

Personally, I don't see what is so special about it.  It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but the food is what I expected walking in.  Spring rolls are not flavorful and has too much minced meat and not enough of veggies for a good balance.  Also, I suspect they are the frozen variety and are not made in house.  Summer rolls are meh....  They're big, but again nothing special.  I've had the pho here and once again Pittsburgh disappoints me in the quality of pho that it has.  At Tram's, the pho bowl is small.  I don't expect a huge basin-size bowl, but a bowl of pho needs to have enough noodle, broth, herbs and spiced.  The meat is too overcooked for pho tai (pho with thinly sliced beef steak that is supposed to be cooked only when the boiling hot broth is poured in the bowl).  The taste is reminiscent of pho but isn't quite right.  You need to want to take your bowl and drink all the broth at the end of the meal and you should feel satisfied and be in a comatose state after a good bowl of pho.  This wasn't it.  \\n\\nThat said, the service is nice.  However, I didn't feel too comfortable/relaxed eating here.  It was dark and crowded (and a little bit dingy).

Televisions with Arabic programs were playing a bit too loudly, but that did not deter us despite wanting a nice atmosphere.

All was well for about 10 minutes.  Then all of a sudden, staff started hauling couches and lounge chairs out of the restaurant and hauling folding tables and chairs in through the back and past our table.  They opened the doors in the back and hauled in several chairs at a time, laying the chairs all over.  It was a circus and the place was freezing because the doors were open.  It was like dining in the middle of a house where the movers came in to move you out.  It was loud, chaotic and anything BUT romantic and pleasant.  At first I politely asked what was going on and to please close the door because we were cold. They did no such thing and the service only got worse.

I was informed that the person who told me that construction would be finished had been wrong and maybe I had called the wrong number because NO ONE there would have EVER said that. Then I was informed that these rooms were just gutted and remodeled, so there was NO WAY that there were stains on any of the pillowcases or that the room was as dirty as I said, but she would send the housekeeping manager up to check.

Not a nicer room for all of our trouble, just a different room. With a worse view. The manager comped our \\\"resort fee\\\" for the three day stay (amounting to a whopping $70 savings). (I'm not entirely sure what the resort fee is for in the first place, since half of the amenities listed on their website seem to not exist.) At this point we asked if we could just get a refund and go to another hotel, or even just to transfer to another property owned by the same company.

We called them, they were rude and less helpful than the hotel, but I'll save that for another review. \\n\\nSo now here we are.

I spoke with the manager and his excuse was that the guy had already given me a discount on the interior. I told him it wasn't fair because an employee had given me that information previously and that was the reason I decided to get an interior wash to begin with! Technically if I have already Pre-paid the wash because I had the Pre-paid cards, what does it matter to give me the $24 off the interior? They owe me $24 of work. Wether its interior or exterior. Good business sense says to do the work now because prices go up and tomorrow when I come in, you can charge me more for it.  Either way, my bad rating is for the bad customer service and unwillingness to work with me and their less than stellar car wash results.

Everyone knows you can't rush perfection.  I waited in heated anticipation.  \\n\\nWhen I arrived, they weren't overly busy (this was on a Saturday night) but it wasn't exactly slow either.  I noticed one of the employees (perhaps part of ownership) was chatting with customers outside.  Hmm, good sign I thought.\\n\\nI then approached the counter and saw through the window the chefs that were crafting my dinner.  There were two - an older and younger gentleman.  A woman also greeted me.  I was welcomed with smiles and the feeling I walked into a household.  I put the pieces together - this appeared to be a family run operation.  \\n\\nI paid for my pizza and wings and as I exited I was thanked for my business by the gentleman that was speaking with the customers outside.\\n\\nAlright, I've driven home the point this is a friendly family run joint.  Now for the pizza and wings review:\\n\\nThe pizza (as others have mentioned) is not cracker thin, but crunchy and crisp.  Good tasting sauce, but where it really shines is the cheese and other toppings.  The sausage (which is stated as homemade) is REALLY good.  There were big chunks of \\\"bulk\\\" (i.e. no casing) italian sausage, not too salty, quality spices, and the onions that I ordered as a separate topping were \\\"slivered\\\" instead of diced.  But again, not overwhelming - rather they were mild and sweet.\\n\\nThe cheese used was a good quality creamy mozzarella - not too stringy but well melted and plentiful.  \\n\\nThe wings were cooked very well, but slightly on the \\\"drier\\\" side as far as sauce goes.  The meat inside is juicy and tender, but these weren't the typical sloppy buffalo wings dripping with sauce.  Personally I'm indifferent as to either style, but a heads up for anyone who likes the more traditional style wings.  I also got 10 drums out of the dozen, which was a bonus.  They also serve pre-packaged Ken's ranch, which is a personal fave.\\n\\nThe pizza was cut into squares, which threw me off a little bit.  Good news is there is less crust, as they really top the entire pizza to the edge, however it was unexpected.  I was skeptical at first but ultimately appreciated the different preparation.  Don't confuse this with an Oregano's style super thin crust experience though - it's a much heartier pizza.  Could it be the imported flour they boast?  Perhaps.\\n\\nFinally, they do deliver now.  Bad news - not open on Sunday, which is often a pizza day for me.  Maybe they'll reconsider at some point, but I'm not going to argue motivation for places not being open on Sundays (although for a pizza place is a little disappointing, especially during football season).\\n\\nOverall they offer very tasty, well crafted food, quality ingredients and a unique spin on otherwise local mundane offerings.  Being it's a local establishment and family run gives me a reason to keep coming back.  A little on the pricey side, but again you are paying for quality.

Our server arrived shortly, and she was fantastic.  She told us that they would be buying us a round of drinks and took our order quickly.  Our food arrived shortly after, and the food was delicious, as it always is, and the service once we were in the dining room was great.

Regretting ordering such a skimpy dish, bff asked for a bit of rice to add to the tacos.  It was provided promptly.  I ordered the chicken Tico Burrito, which was...surprise..a chicken burrito.  Not bad, but if I had been wearing socks, they would have remained firmly in place.  The green jalapeno-based sauce, when generously applied to the burrito, did add some much-needed character.  \\n\\nThe bill- with one drink each ($7.00 each for a mojito!!) the bill came to just under $37.00.

He claimed that that was policy, their computer couldn't figure out it per couple, and that our organizer was lying when they said the restaurant agreed to separate checks.  \\n\\nThey didn't staff up for our large group and the poor waiter was extremely busy and dealing with too many tables.   He did not mention the table tip of 18% would be on the total before the happy hour discount.  There was no happy hour menu, nor was this gratutity published.  We have done other group happy hours and we know this is common practice (paying tip on the pre-discount price, and that would be fine.)... however other restaurants have figured out the bills for us.  \\n\\nThe tip on the total would also be fine if he had taken the time to tell each couple what they owed as he had promised.  However he just gave us the bill and we had to figure it out.  The bill was incorrect in that it came in at the total price.  So he redid the bill.

I have been to many Indian lunch buffets, but this was the first time I've seen such cheap dining ware being used. While they had several vegetarian offerings, they only had a couple of mediocre meat dishes: chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken. There was a huge tray of naan which looked overly doughy and dried out so I didn't even bother trying it. The subpar mango pudding was too watery and contained cheap canned fruit. The halwa dessert was extremely dry and just gross. My friend and I commented that the only thing at the buffet that they seemed to do pretty well was the basmati rice.\\n\\nWhen the bill came, I was in for another shock. $12.95 for an Indian lunch buffet?!? That has got to make this the priciest one in town since most are in the range of $9.99 to $10.99. Now if this buffet was one of the best, I probably wouldn't mind paying a premium price. Come to think of it, if they lowered the price to $8.95, it still wouldn't be worth it.

I'm with Joel J. - I don't get all the hype or the 4 star rating for Vanguard Lounge. I came here with a group of four people on a Saturday night around 12:30AM. This is prime time people. The Groupon I bought earlier the same night is what brought me to Vanguard.  \\n\\nPros: There's no cover charge.\\nCons: There's no cover charge, so the place is even more so infested with hoodlums. \\n\\nWhen our group walked in, we were immediately turned off by the music that was playing (hip-hop) and the plain, unattractive layout of the bar. The place was empty-ish, but after about 30 minutes a tidal wave of partiers entered. The place was so packed that we were constantly being bumped into. I had a mild panic attack as we were leaving because I had to squeeze, push, and fight my way through the dance floor to get out of the club and breathe some fresh air. Did I mention I'm slightly claustrophobic?\\n\\nVanguard is in a great location. It's located smack dab on the main Fremont drag next to Insert Coins and the Beat Coffeehouse. It's convenient to stop by if you're bar hopping along East Fremont, but the centralized location is pretty much the only positive thing about Vanguard. \\n\\nService at the bar was okay. We were served relatively quickly considering how busy it was. I ordered 4 Irish Trash Cans (A Long Island with Blue Curacao and Peach Schnapps). The total came to $48. I was peeved at the $12 a piece price tag, especially since the drinks were served in dinky little plastic cups. I mean, c'mon, I could go to the much classier Wayfarer bar across the street and pay the same amount for a drink that tasted and looked a million times better. \\n\\nThere's nothing going for Vanguard. I definitely won't come back. Everyone in my group thought the place sucked.

No host/hostess was in sight.  After we were seated, they took our order quickly and returned with our salads and then we waited...and waited...and waited. They didn't even offer us bread while we were waiting until we asked. The bread was fresh and soft but the oil was an overkill. Imagine 95% oil, 5% vinegar. 35 minutes later as we waited, a cockroach decided to join the party. It ran across the wall under one of the paintings and attempted to hop in my friend's purse. We let our server know but by the time he returned with something to kill the cockroach, it disappeared. That should have been our cue to leave but instead we decided to relocate to the front dining area. One hour and 15 minutes later plus 2 and a half loaves of bread, our food arrived. I ordered the sausage and mushroom rigatoni, and my friend ordered the champagne chicken. The sausage and mushroom rigatoni was subpar. It was basically rigatoni drowning in a store bought vodka sauce garnished with a handful of mushrooms and cut up sausage. The champagne chicken was terrible. The texture of the chicken breast was like plastic and it was pale in color. Neither of the dishes were hot either. It was definitely not worth $20.00. To top it off, the server was rushing us to pay our bill.

I was all good about it, he had never been to the groomers because I am a do it yourself person.

So I did and then gave them my moms contact number.\\n\\nWell I noticed at 5 pm that I had received no information, so I called my mom and said did you pick him up? No, OK well then have they called? She said no. So I called and spoke with the and they said oh we have just been so busy give me an hour.

We had the artichoke hearts, crab puffs, and escargots for appetizers.  I didn't get the sense that the seafood was fresh.  Rather it was definitely of the frozen variety.  And everything was made with frozen puff pastry.  Even the escargot were covered with puff pastry. I think it was to cover for the frozen seafood?  Anyway, the appetizers reminded me of Pinterest recipes.  \\n\\nA big red flag for me is when there are too many components in a dish.  That usually means that the ingredients aren't good enough to stand out on their own or the chef doesn't know how to edit.  I think we experienced a little of both.  \\n\\nMy husband and I both got the special. It was a blackened pork tenderloin with shrimp accompanied by mushrooms in a sherry sauce with red potatoes.  Each component sounded good.  However, the presentation and preparation was a train wreck.  \\n\\nThe tenderloin came on skewers.  What?  The shrimp were over cooked.  The meat and shrimp were served in a jumble of quartered red potatoes and mushrooms.  Everything was covered in some sort of Cajun seasoning that was reminiscent of Durkee or McCormick.  Then it was all topped with some sort of cornstarch thickened sherry sauce.  The whole thing tasted like it was straight off the Sysco truck  and reheated. \\n\\nOne of our companions ordered the filet.  She let us have a taste, and the steak was good.  But it came with a buerre blanc dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what chef would pair buerre blanc with steak to begin with, but just like my meal, it was clear that the buerre blanc was another corn starch imposter.  \\n\\nDessert was a dark chocolate creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e.  It was dry and pedestrian.  \\n\\nReally I think this place deserves 2.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't do half stars, so I'll be generous.  Lousiannes clearly has a loyal customer base and is a popular place.  I would definitely go back for the cocktails and even the appetizers because the price point wasn't outrageous for all the puff pastry and I could still enjoy them now that I know what to expect.  \\n\\nBut I would not return for dinner.  If I'm going to spend $30 for an entree, I expect fresh ingredients, sauces made to order, and a chef that knows how to cook.

Ah what a delicious heart attack in a mini baking tin\\n\\nCod brandade beignets with tomato confit & fried sage - I had no idea what to expect but these weren't like the beignets I've tried before, almost like a light, crispy potato or taro fritter and also really good.

Again, fantastic and with a totally different flavour to black sausage it tasted quite meaty like any good breakfast sausage and something I could see myself enjoying with eggs and a french toast.\\n\\nSteak frites - Now I've been to NYC Brasserie Les Halles which prides itself on its steak frites, but to be honest theirs seems like an overcooked, flat piece of meat compared to what Bouchon serves up, good lord, you get a surprisingly thick and juicy piece of steak for surprisingly not a bad price.

You would assume being inside a casino, they would charge more than the actual dish is worth, but the price range is about $6-8 for a good portion of food per dish. \\n\\nMy dad would be the one to know all the technical stuff with what is a good quality Chinese dish and bad quality. The reason why I know this restaurant really lives up to the 'Best Chinese Restaurant' awards plastered around the entrance is because the traffic that I have seen come in and out of this restaurant, and the number of to-go orders that are bunched up on their large counter space everytime I am here. It's ridiculous! We've had to wait a good 45 minutes for our to-go order (3 dishes) to come out, so my advice is if you're looking for some take-out.. make sure you order way ahead of time of when you expect to actually eat.\\n\\nHad dimsum the other day and they don't have a wide variety of options but for what they do have, it's superb quality in my opinion! Really loved their turnip cake. Best I've ever had! \\n\\n4 instead of 5 stars is just because I wish their floor space was a little larger and had more selection of dimsum items, but as for their quality of food.. 5 stars for sure.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Text: I was a little disappointed.

Then a certain caution sweeps over me since so many dim sum places around the valley don't even come close to those found in other cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. So when a friend of mine and local ice cream guru, Helen Yung from Sweet Republic, told me about a new dim sum joint that reminded her of Hong Kong, I was elated to try it as soon as possible.\\n\\nPhoenix Palace is quickly becoming a jack of all trades sort of restaurant. During the week they have seafood and Chinese buffets, a full menu with free delivery, and on the weekends rolling cart dim sum as well as a take out BBQ section. While carts only roll on the weekends, dim sum can be ordered any day of the week off of a smaller menu. We came just for the weekend cart dim sum, the BBQ section in the front of the restaurant looked amazing. In the window wrapped onto stainless steels hooks were selections of whole roasted duck, pork spare ribs and roasted chicken. I haven't seen a display like this one since being in Chinatown in San Francisco a few months back, very impressive. Come early or call ahead if you want to enjoy a roast duck to-go, when we left the display was pretty much wiped out.\\n\\nWalking into the Phoenix Palace you'll immediately notice that you're not in Kansas anymore, the clientele is mostly Asian who have very discerning palates. You know you're in the right place when the target market is ethnic and not American. No worries about communication break down, the staff speaks English, even if it is a little broken. Though all you really need are your senses to guide you through the dim sum experience. After being sat, the carts will start rolling by your table to peddle their vast variety of dumplings. Each cart person will open a steam basket for you to take a look inside and along with a brief explanation, usually consisting of only one word, they stamp your tally card and move on. The carts don't come in any sort of order so just have fun and order away. If something looks even remotely good go ahead, it's really inexpensive.\\n\\nOne of the main difference between Phoenix Palace and the other dim sum restaurants, is the fact that not only do they offer 75+ different items, but here it's not only fresh but made in house. One of the carts that come about is a fry cart which at first seemed unusual. It's a stainless steel ride with a built in cook top where some items are crisped and heated table side which made perfect sense after one bite. In all of the places I've had dim sum, here and in other cities, I have never seen or heard of this before. Helen told me that she hadn't seen something like that since having dim sum in Hong Kong. If Helen is impressed, I'm blown away! We started with an order of Green Leek Gow ($3.15), with a translucent skin showing a silhouette of diced leeks and chopped shrimp, then crisped up on either side for a textural symphony. We also ordered the Pan Fried Pork Bun ($3.15) which had a slightly crisped edges filled with tender chopped pork, each bite was simply sublime. These were so good we ordered an additional plate of those chubby meat filled pillows.\\n\\nThe standards are done extremely well here, such as the Steamed BBQ Pork Bun ($2.15), as well as the baked version ($2.15) with its covering of sweet sticky glaze. If you've never experienced a BBQ Pork Bun in either incarnation, you really should. This is the all about savory, salty and sweet, dip in some chili paste for an added spicy dimension. Chinese Broccoli ($5.25) is slightly bitter, slightly sweet and has a crunchiness that pairs well with the softer noodle dishes like the Beef Rice Noodle Roll ($3.15). Long sheets of rice noodles are filled with sliced tender beef, rolled and then steamed. When delivered to your table, a lightly sweetened soy sauce is poured over the top. Shui Mai ($2.15) is as tender and flavorful as it was meant to be, porky and delicious.\\n\\nDessert dim sum is as much fun as its savory counterpart. Sesame Balls ($2.15) filled with sweetened red bean paste, surrounded by sticky rice, then rolled in sesame seeds and deep fried were pretty much a crowd pleaser. The Snow Bun ($2.15) was a new one that I've never seen or tasted before. A cloud of pure heaven filled with creamy custard, served warm, blew away any doughnut that's graced my lips. I also ordered a box of them to-go so they could be enjoyed again later. The tall and billowy Brown Sugar Rice Cake ($2.15) reminded me more of a yellow cake though was very good, hot and fresh out of the steam basket.\\n\\nThere aren't too many places where you can try so many different textures and flavor in one sitting. So it really is an experience to have dim sum with a close group of pals because food always seems to bring us just a little bit closer.\n"}, {"label": "positive", "sentence": "Text: I always get tbe philly with pepper relish,  really good!

I had the coconut shrimp, which was overcooked. The dipping sauce was supposed to be guacamole based, but it tasted mostly like sour cream so I skipped it. The veggies as the side order came out colder than the rest of the food, and were limp and mushy. The seasoning was overbearing, as all the flavor had been cooked out of the vegetables. One person had the cheeseburger, which they said was delicious, loaded with greens, and cooked perfectly to her order. Another person had the fish and chips, and the fish was over cooked and chewy. Both of them raved about the french fries. Another person had the catfish, which was over salted. It was served with rice, and for some reason I guess we were expecting white rice - but it came out with Mexican style fried rice - which just threw us off, I suppose.

Their \\\"from the grill\\\" section averaged at about $25 per plate...

We are beer nerds so it makes for a lovely surprise that a unassuming Bistro would have such an impressive drink menu. The BF wasn't sure of what, and our server (I think possibly the owner) asked what kinds of flavors he likes and gave a few recommendations. I always appreciate a place that knows what they sell since it seems most people don't care about beer the way they do of wine. The BF took his suggestion of a Augustjn Abbey Ale ($7) and I had a Troubadour Obscura ($7) which the guy poured into TULIPS with care to produce a proper head! I had a nerd moment that they had the proper kind of glasses and someone cared about our drinks as much as we do. He treated it like a sommelier would a fine wine. \\n\\nWhile we waited for food we were served papadam with a tamarind chutney and a cilrantro mint chutney. All really finely made. \\n\\nFor food we really couldn't decide to we went with a Indian Sampler ($30). It doesn't look like a lot of food, but we were both comfortably full.\\n\\nIt includes:\\n\\n*chicken tikka masala- this was a lovely tikka. I've had a lot and this was one of the better ones I've had. Very robust, but balanced. The BF loved this and raves it's the best curry he's had and he had a foodie moment (aww, I think us Yelpers are getting to him...maybe he'll change his mind about doing reviews one day). \\n\\n*lamb vindaloo- the lamb was very tender and the sauce complimented it very well with a bit earthiness, tangyness and a tad spicy. \\n\\n*tandoori chicken- crisp and nicely spiced outside, juicy inside\\n\\n*mixed veggie curry- had a good mix of cauliflower, zucchini, beans, peppers. The curry had a very light and fragrant flavor to it...I can't quite place the spices, but I liked this. \\n\\n*chef choice of lentils- today it was daal. I like daal since it's earthy and comforting. \\n\\n*we got yoghurt, basmati rice, and garlic naan as well. The naan was pretty noms here. \\n\\n*Khir came with it for dessert. It's a rice and milk porridge with raisins, nuts and cardamom according to the menu. When I was eating it, to me it tasted more flowery than just cardamom, like possible orange blossom water was added. It's the kind of light dessert that would be amazing for a hot summer day since it's served cold and has such bright flavors.\\n\\nWe also ordered another dessert that I thought I had and loved at another restaurant and at friends house but haven't come across it in a while. Turns out it was what I was looking for! \\n\\nLal Mohan ($2.99) the description says it's served cold, but it's served piping hot! It's these round pastries that are fried so the outside is crisp and the inside has a creamy kind of dough. They throw it into syrup and it absorbs it so it flavors it throughout.They come 3 to a serving in a shot glass, balls are about gumball sized so you don't get much of it, but it's quality. It's a comforting kind of dessert that would be a good for people who like fried mochi with honey, warm donuts, zeppolis, beignets. \\n\\nThe service was friendly and helpful. I like the little details that show they care like having proper beer glasses or giving us warm plates. Utensils were impeccably polished- no water marks at all.

I didn't try their other carved meats like their chicken, brisket, ham etc however they all looked delicious.  The mac and cheese and other sides were amazing.\\n\\nReason i only give it a 3 is because for a buffet to get anything higher i think the food should not taste like \\\"buffet\\\" food.   Especially when your dropping 40 to 50 bucks including tax and tip.   Some buffets do this.   Aria doesn't.   I think for less money you could go to any of the lower end hotels and still get the same buffet and same food.  Aside from the carved meat station and the seafood (crab legs and peeled shrimp) everything else wasn't even good it was average at best.   Mexican food stale.  Asian food stale and horrible.   The rest were standard things like fried chicken breasts potato wedges etc.\\n\\nIf your gonna come here go straight to the carved meats (rotisserie chicken, prime rib, brisket, etc).

The crust was light and fluffy, reminiscent of puff pastry dough.\\n\\nThe seviche special was swordfish and I expected tough and fishy, and got just the opposite.  Light and tasty with a great citrus and spice flavor that worked well with the simply prepared but yummy fried plantains.   \\n\\nThe pulled port tamale was quite good, probably the best I have had in the Pittsburgh area.

That's because it's very small and very popular.  After 2 failed attempts, I was finally able to get a reservation for this past Sat. night.  Cure is located right on the corner of 54th and Butler in the \\\"dodgy\\\" end of Lawrenceville.  There's street parking only, no valet.  The space is very small but warm.  When we first walked in we heard Vampire Weekend blasting over the speakers so I figured this would be a good place.  Speaking of music, the other reviewers are correct that it is very loud (which may or may not be your thing).  We heard a ton of great bands which included Modest Mouse and The Clash.  I actually liked this because if you have good tunes, at least play them at a volume where people can hear them.  Some places like to say they have good tunes but don't play them loud enough for anyone to hear them (I'm looking at you Salt of the Earth).\\n\\nCure is BYOB only so I brought 2 bottles of beer:  Dogfish Head Noble Rot and Great Divide Yeti Oak-Aged Imperial Stout.  One of the waiters was very intrigued by the Noble Rot so I poured him some to try (will be important later).  We started off with the \\\"salumi for 2\\\" to get an introduction to the restaurant's specialty of cured meats.  The plate consisted of crostini with lardo, mordatella (fancy bologna), duck speck, chicken rillettes, chorizo, and cornichon (pork scraps).  It was all tasty (if you like this kind of stuff, and not everyone does), but the plate was very small.  It was really a \\\"salumi for 1\\\" and at $18, seemed a little steep.\\n\\nFor an entree, I had the duck breast and leg.  It was a very small plate.  Although delicious, there were only 2 small pieces of duck breast and most of the dish was leg confit.  I would have loved to have had more of the breast and at $28, this also seemed steep for the portion size.\\n\\nWe finished up with a cheese plate (again rather small) and the chocolate \\\"souffle\\\" cake (which didn't really have anything to do with chocolate souffle and was also small).  Both were very good, but again the portions were small.\\n\\nI think Cure has a lot of potential.  The food is extremely flavorful, but the portions are just slightly too small for the current price point.  I'm not saying Cure should be giving out huge plates of food, but for $28 I'd like to have more than 2 small pieces of duck breast.  \\n\\nBYOB has it's own unique appeal and I think that Cure has immediately become the best BYOB place in Pittsburgh.  The corkage is only $3.  As a final point, I was slightly miffed when I saw that I was charged corkage for the beer that we shared with a waiter.  I'm always happy to share great beer with anyone, but it would have been a classy move to comp us the corkage for that bottle.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Text: Just had Rob back again.

I was surprised considering it was a Saturday evening.  I could have sworn it was going to be packed (totally wrong... we were the only ones there).  I had purchased 2 races for each of us.  Since we were the only one there, the worker running the track gave us the option to do one 20 minute run or the typical two runs at 10 minutes a piece.  He recommended doing the 20 minute run as it would allow to master all the turns and give us a chance to conquer the track.  I figured that it was an awesome opportunity to do so and that's what we did.  He ended up beating the first half of the race, but I finished in first at the end.  \\n\\nInfo & Tips:\\n   If you have never been to Fast Lap, be prepared by bringing your driver's license and to fill out a waiver prior to starting.  The next step is watching a 2 minute safety video.  It's a little cheesy, but your attention is needed.  After doing so, I recommend you use the restroom if need be.  You don't want to suit up then have to use the restroom 2 minutes before race time!  I love dressing up.  I think it's part of the experience.  Suit up in your choice of red or black.  After going through the second set of doors, you have other safety gear to put on(not in this order ha):  Helmet, head sock, neck brace, and racing gloves (optional just like the race suit).  \\n  Don't forget to pick up your paper, which tracks your best time, fastest lap, top speed, etc. etc.  Keep it for bragging rights and take a picture with it on the podium (you'll see the podium).  \\n  Totally awesome.  More so if they had helmets with visors that weren't scratched.  If you have your own helmet, you may bring that one.  Don't forget to check out the photo wall in the office and see what celebs have raced the tracks of Fast Lap.  I'd most definitely recommend this place.  Even though it's family fun, I wouldn't recommend it for younger kids.  I could see how it could be dangerous...and don't think that you are too old to have fun at Fast Lap.

I researched reviews before deciding to purchase tickets and many of them lowered my expectations especially the quality of the food and mentions of using office chairs and there was nothing explain what the couples seating looked like. Looking at the seating chart it was hard to imagine what the seats were like because there were no pictures, which made me suspicious; were hiding something? It was common sense to me that the office type chairs must be located at the counter seating (C) and the couple seating were the (A) & (B) selections and they had to be a different style, which turned out to be somewhat accurate. The seating chart has dotted lines leading you to think these were short sections of counters but that wasn't so, in actuality there is a solid line of counters stretching from one side to the other of the auditorium with the office type chairs lined up behind them. The chart also doesn't reflect how much spacing there is between the rows, so for those reading this there is a 5' walking isle behind the office chairs and the couples seating is directly behind that, then the next length of counter space is directly behind those seats and so on. They could use a lesson from how iPic shows their seating charts, like the spacing and layout where the seats are placed along with pictures. The isle walking space was convenient for the servers and people to use, unlike other theaters (including iPic) that you have to excuse yourself as you squeeze through to get to the end isles. The couple seats are like over-sized office chairs but without the wheels and swivels, the center arm rest will flip up and the back tilts slightly, they were about as comfortable as the soft tilting back chairs as some Harkins and AMC theaters have. The VIP (V) seats were at the ends of the rows which don't get the best sound and screen quality and they appeared to be a little softer but because of the location there is nothing VIP about them. \\nNow the food; well I've had worse at theaters but for the price I would expect better. The $10 all you can eat pizza was OK but nothing special and better than heated up frozen pizzas like most theaters have. I had pepperoni first then Italian sausage; both needed more meat or thicker slices as the meat flavor was over powered by the dough and sauce. My wife chose the overpriced Tenderloin Tip entree with sweet potato fries which were warm and soft with no crunch at all and the meat was hospital food bland but good after she doused it with salt and pepper. But if you think about it all theater foods and snacks are overpriced, as Dan Harkins once said in an interview, \\\"I sell popcorn, candy and soda, the movies are included in the price\\\", meaning if they didn't have concessions less people would go to the movies because the price would be so high to pay for the reel rentals. I liked the plastic serving dishes because they were quite, the noise of clinking plates and utensils at iPic drives me nuts when you're used to a quieter environment in a theater. \\nThe bar was well stocked and the prices were about the same as the surrounding pubs and restaurants, if you order beer and plan of having more than 4-glasses order a large picture, they won't mention it but it's a better deal until they read this and figure it out, then it might change.

Someone had made a sale.  This is REALLY when I should have walked out.  It was so annoying.  On to the salesperson.  What followed from there was nothing less than very poor customer service.

I would eat here more often if it was more convenient.  To me, the gyro here is the best in Pittsburgh.  Better than ANY other.  Until someone can point me at a Gyro place that makes them like they do in some of the larger cities in the U.S., or like in Greece or Turkey, where they hand make the meat on a spit, it is lamb sliced thin, and placed in layers on a skewer, then slow roasted, and sliced and served while you watch, then Salonikas will remain the best.  \\n\\nSeriously, every single Gyro place around here just buys that big round slab of processed meat, and puts it on a spinner. Folks that say \\\"Oh it is seasoned so perfectly at XXXX\\\" are nuts.  No place around here makes their own lamb gyro meat. If you know of one, put it down, I want to go there.\\n\\nI like Salonikas because I like the pita, it is nice and thick and chewy, and they fry it on the flat top.  Places that don't heat the pita (like that place on the Strip that sells Gyros for $5 and he don't even heat the pita?!?!) They STINK!  \\n\\nI like the tszaziki (however you spell it).  It is nice and thick and well seasoned.  It does not go running down your arm when you take a big honking bite of your gyro.  \\n\\nI like the meat, it is seasoned so perfectly!  (!?!?!) Actually, they cook it long enough to make it a bit crusty, and they slice it nice and thin.  And they put on a LOT of it.  \\n\\nAnd all the veg is just right.  I wish they used hotter onions, but oh well.\\n\\nAnd best of all, they have a bar, that is VERY fairly priced.  Especially considering it is located so near the theatre district.  I also absolutely like all the other stuff they have, the spanakopata, and the moussaka, and the grape leaves.  Pretty much anything they sell.\\n\\nAnd keep this in mind, this place is inexpensive.  I mean seriously, the negative reviews this place gets all seem to say \\\"the prices are cheap, and tastes it\\\".  Well, bull.  The food is inexpensive, and what you get for what they charge, is way above what you expect.  Like, instead of ground lamb in some dishes, you get ground beef.  Still tastes good to me.  Not as great as it would be with ground lamb, but it keeps the price down, and it still tastes good.\\n\\nMy favorite time to eat here?  New Years eve, or Pittsburgh Light Up Night.  I have been here every one of those the past three years, they are packed, you get to have a gyro and a beer.  It is just a nice fun time.  And considering how busy they are, the staff are all way happier that at some of those pinky-in-the-air joiunts in the theatre district.\\n\\nOh, and the customers are all friendly.  Nice mix of blue collar and cops and folks getting a bite before or after some event in the cultural district.  I REALLLY like this place.  \\n\\nNow, next reviewer who throws down some ignorant review about how some other gyro is better, first, is it a REAL gyro, made with REAL thin sliced lamb, slow cooked on a spit and sliced off fresh and juicy, then PLEASE put the name of the place in your review.  I have tried EVERY gyro spot in the city, and quite a few outside it.  And I am STILL looking for a REAL gyro made like that.

Everything else about this place did...\\n\\nThe food was nothing special and bordered on horrible. Garlic cheese bread was soggy in some places while overbaked around the corners. Chicken tenders were clearly just reheated out of a frozen bag , which could be alright since they come flavored-dipped, except they give you 4 of the most pathetic looking pieces for $8 and the sauces sucked. If you're looking for good bar food you can do 1000x better elsewhere in Vegas; if you're looking for crap, then I guess you've discovered the right place.\\n\\nBar food can be hit or miss, so what else is going on at Tap House? $3.50 for a on-tap Hoegaarden wasn't bad, but it was a rather small glass given what can be had at other area sports bars. Their beer selection is average; nothing special. \\n\\nFinally, what brought me to this place. They advertise themselves as the home of Cleveland's sports teams, so being a Cleveland sports nut, I decided to go here for Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Bad call. Half of the crowd wasn't paying any attention, which while not the place's fault, probably wasn't helped by the fact that half the TVs were on other things (replays of old Dodger games and trivial pursuit reruns). Adding insult to this injury? Their placemat that proclaims their love of the Cavs SPELLS CAVALIERS INCORRECTLY (see the picture I've uploaded). Seriously guys? That's inexcusable. \\n\\nSo to recap: don't come here for the food, not worth coming here for the drinks, and definitely not an actual Cleveland sports bar.

For comparison, my father and I were in the mood for sushi, so we made a reservation at Jjanga in Chinatown, and a certain pan-Asian bistro, at a Forbes Five Star property, on Las Vegas Boulevard. Both reservations were made online and both noted my father's nut allergy. The following morning, Jjanga sent us a personal email, thanking us for the reservation, expressing their pleasure in our choosing to dine with them, and what items on the menu contained nuts. I replied to this email, a short thank you of sorts, and even received a personal confirmation for this. The restaurant on the Forbes Five Star property made no such connection, genuine sense of interest, or anticipatory service. At that point, we completely cancelled our reservation with the bistro on Las Vegas Boulevard and committed to Jjanga. Once your inside, such attentive service continues. Our waitress essentially greeted us at our table, immediately took our drink orders, and visited us several times. We were not a special party though, we could see her and the rest of the wait staff constantly running about the venue, never once stopping. \\n\\nRegarding the cuisine, some may say that the sushi menu lacks diversity. I guess that is true in regards to the specific kinds of fish served, but the combinations and pairings of ingredients create a hearty and fruitful selection. Jjanga even seems to acknowledge this limitation, for it does not offer specifically sashimi options on the menu, instead dedicating space to rolls, non-rice rolls, and unique creations. A true mark of culinary skill is working around a boundary with apparent ease. Before reading the other reviews, I had forgotten the lack of strictly sashimi options. Who cares? For a traditional Japanese sushi joint in - let's remember - the God damn desert, my palate was excellently entertained.\\n\\nAs my father said in regards to the atmosphere, Jjanga \\\"lacks pretension.\\\" Jjanga is dedicated to the food and service, without being too serious for sushi novices and out-of-state visitors. Everyone is welcome and appreciated, and the decor reflects that in a playful yet tasteful following of Vegas's themed design, which offers several seating options that can feel more private and intimate. It says, \\\"We know you're here to have fun, so here's something just a taste kitsch, but properly cozy too.\\\"\\n\\nJjanga is a place for locals as well as vistors, so casual attire is most appropriate. That said, if you're travelling from the Boulevard, to taste something authentic and a little warmer, maybe show the respect to put on a jacket and some nice shoes like you would have at a comparable place at a hotel-casino. Jjanga maybe be more casual than some of those options, but it's still a class act that can compete with any Boulevard venue.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Text: Phukin awesome, is the best way I can describe there work.

Both were delectable.\\n\\nOur first pizza, Salami e Funghi, combined the bold flavors of salami, crimini mushrooms, and kalamata olives with fresh mozzarella and crushed tomato sauce. The salty meat and olives perfectly complement the slightly sweet sauce and creamy cheese, with the mushrooms adding a smoky earthiness. The crisp, flavorful crust held these ingredients together beautifully, and was also delicious when eaten by itself.\\n\\nThe Prosciutto and Arugula was more subdued, yet equally impressive.  The stars of this pizza were the prosciutto, sliced razor-thin and layered generously across the pie, and fresh mozzarella, a familiar favorite by now. Olive oil, rosemary, and red onion provided a more subtle sweetness than tomato sauce, but were a nice balance to the bold and complex flavor of the prosciutto.  A pile of fresh arugula and freshly grated parmesan provided a hearty finish. And again, the crust shined in its own right.\\n\\nAlong with our pizzas, we also enjoyed a wonderfully composed caprese salad.  Thick slices of mozzarella were paired with roasted local tomatoes, a hearty crusty bread, and a generous drizzle of olive oil.

If I took price into account I might go 4 starts but I wanted to focus purely on the experience of the food and that means, I would eat it again but if I could get one in the more traditional fashion, even if it cost me a bit more, I would go for that type Vietnamese sandwich.\\n\\nWhat I did like is that one can also order full size baguettes at the same time the sandwich is ordered and like the sandwiches, quite inexpensive at only $1.25 each. I bought one and started eating it on the way home (yes, I know, crumbs everywhere but that is why they have those vacuums at the car wash). I could see picking up a loaf or two of this bread every weekend as I like the crunchy crust and the wonderfully soft interior of their loafs.\\n\\nI also had an iced mint milk and well, that was rather blah, tasted overly sweet and artificial so not something I would order again but they have a lot of other options.\\n\\nBottom line....the bread is great, the sandwiches a great deal if you are looking for value for your money and an okay deal if you are looking for the highest quality Vietnamese sandwich.

Until now.  \\n\\nCamille is now twelve years old, nearly 100 pounds, and almost five feet tall.  She is non-ambulatory, non-verbal, has autistic-like sensitivities, and often will require one or more diaper changes on a long flight.  Consequently, we always sit as close to the back of the plane as possible, as she is much too large to change in the tiny bathroom, and past flight crews have been very accommodating in arranging to either block off the aisle, screen off the last row of seats, or allow us to use the floor of the galley when everything is locked down After service.  \\n\\nWe were explaining this to the flight crew and Ms Owens when she took it upon herself to insist that that absolutely could not be done, that we were only allowed to change Camille in the bathroom, which is physically impossible, and to aggressively verbally berate my wife Christina over wanting to make some arrangement so that we could get to our destination with a minimum of discomfort and inconvenience to ourselves and our fellow passengers.  \\n\\nHer aggression set off our daughter into a loud and prolonged screaming fit.

So when I got to purchase the stereo, I was told that they didn't have any in stock & that I would have to go to the Paradise Valley store!  Why didn't they tell me that in the first place!  So I got to Paradise Valley store AFTER I called to put the item on hold since they screwed up and didn't want to drive all the way down there for nothing.  When I picked up the stereo, I asked about installation & the charged $125 for JUST the install.  Any needed items were extra.  What?  No one told me about extra items.  So I purchase another kit for the installation.  I decided to go back to Frys & just get the upgraded stereo and pay only $65 for install (and I had all the parts I needed) then I would return the stereo back to Best Buy.  Well the stereo I saw at Frys was gone : ( they had sold it when I left the store.  Bummer!  Anyway, the installed my stereo and was very happy with Frys.

Here's what happened...\\n\\nAbout a week prior to our visit, I called and made a dinner reservation for a table of 12 for the following Saturday night.  I requested a table outside, after confirming that there would be ample heaters should it get chilly.  I was told that would be no problem (on all counts), and the reservation was booked.  The day before our dinner, we had one more decide to join us.  I called the restaurant back, requesting that we add one more.  They again assured me that would be no problem, and confirmed the reservation on the patio, now for 13.\\n\\nThree of us arrived at Grazie about 30 minutes prior to our reservation time, expecting to get a glass of wine at the bar while we waited for our group to arrive.  The hostess informed us that the table was ready, and we could just sit there if we wanted.  No problem.  When we get to the table, the only heater close to us was off, so we asked if they could turn it on.  The hostess said she would send someone right out, and that our server would be with us shortly.  Twenty minutes later, the server came over and took our wine and appetizer order (mind you, the heater is still off at this point).  We asked her again if we could have someone turn it on, and she said she'd have someone come over.  Ten minutes later our group began to arrive...and we still hadn't even received so much as a glass of water.  After another 10 minutes or so, the wine and appetizers arrived....but no silverware.   We had to wait another 15 minutes to get our waitresses attention and request silverware, and get the rest of our party's drink orders in.  In addition, we asked for the heater to be turned on again.....\\n\\nThroughout dinner, service was incredibly slow, items were forgotten (my friend ordered a coffee, which came black - with no request of if she would like cream or sugar - and again it took forever to track down the server to get it)...After our 5th or 6th request to have the heater turned on, one member of the table actually went inside to ask someone else if we could get it turned on.  The waitress came back to the table and told us that the propane tank was empty, but they'd have another one moved over to our table (ummm why did they put out a heater with an empty propane tank in the first place??)..again, two or three requests later and the 'new' heater still had not been moved to the table.  All of a sudden, a busboy showed up with a lighter, and lit our ORIGINAL heater - apparently NOT empty, and about an hour and a half late.\\n\\nWhen we received the bill, an automatic 20% gratuity was added (due to the party's size) which we felt should be disputed based on the horrible service we had received thus far.  So two of us went inside to speak to a manager about our experience.  The owner, a fairly grumpy man, let us get out two words before he started spouting all the defenses he could think of as to why the service was bad....\\\"short staffed, not enough silverware, busier than usual, etc\\\".  Not once was there an apology for the service received.  At one point, he interrupted me (again) to say \\\"what is it you want from me\\\"...I said \\\"i'd like you to at least listen to me.  You haven't let us finish a single sentence yet\\\"....at which point he threw up his arms and said \\\"i don't have time for this.  It's not my fault you had bad service, that's your server's fault\\\".  I have to say, I was incredibly impressed at his quick willingness to throw the server under the bus after already stating they were \\\"short staffed, etc\\\".

Well Saturday came, I called to verify my rugs were there so we could get them, I was informed that no, they had not been put on the truck and were at the warehouse. I live in the San tan valley and if I wanted my rugs that day( the day I was told) I would have to drive to down town Phoenix to the warehouse and get them myself. So my husband did, got there waited an hour and finally was given 2 rolled up rugs. He gets them home and 1 is the same rug I brought home from the store. I called to inform them I had gotten the wrong rug \\\"Jewel\\\" answered and said They would re-order the correct rug and we were to bring the wrong one back in ASAP. So my husband drove it back up on Monday. He then waited for them to let him know when the new rug would be in, finally the extremely unprofessional manager \\\"Ralph\\\" came out said \\\"your rug isn't available, it's on back order you shouldn't of been able to even buy it in the first place\\\" and walked away. That was it. No apology, no offer of a solution. Nothing. So he came home told me all this I called back to store spoke with Jewel again tried explaining my frustration and trying to figure out when I would be able to get my rug and she kept cutting me off, was extremely rude and acted like I was of no significance. I said for being in customer service your not being very helpful and her respond was I'm not customer service Im the back office. I then asked to speak to someone that would give a crap about my concerns and she said you can call our customer service number. I asked her to please tell me what my options were she said they would re order the rug and have it by the next Saturday. Well guess what it's Saturday and I just called.... The rug wasn't delivered! Her excuse was the computers were down for 3 days so the order wasn't placed until yesterday and that apparently wasn't enough time for them to get a stupid rug put on a truck in phx and delivered to Mesa...... Anyways. I canceled the order and will never return to this store again!

The only Blu-Rays are usually in a display stand outside of the electronic section. Clothing, men's clothing to be exact, is pretty bad. They pretty much have a few basics like khakis, polo shirts, and some athletic stuff but that's pretty much it.

In this case electing for a two-top near the doors I took my seat where silverware wrapped in napkins along with the menu were already in place and grabbing a copy of the local paper I started to peruse the menu moments before service would arrive, a pleasant young lady named Samantha who appeared to be the only server working the room.\\n\\nClearly a place for regulars as nearly ever patron to enter after me was greeted by name Samantha welcomed me and filling my water asked if I'd like coffee while I perused the menu; an offer I gladly agreed to when I noted that they were serving the same locally roasted Caf\\u00e9 Cortez as the day prior at Morning Glory.  \\n\\nWith my coffee being readied and having already perused the online menu I would be ready to order by the time Samantha returned and with the time just before 7:00 I opted for two dishes, both garnering a \\\"good choice,\\\" and sat back to read the paper and listen to the overhead radio while I waited perhaps fifteen minutes for my plates to arrive.\\n\\nWith service efficient and friendly throughout my stay and coffee maintained near full along with my water my two plates would arrive simultaneously and having heard some (Food Network) call Over Easy the best breakfast in the state while the posters on the walls hailed Fieri's commentary I started first with their signature item of Waffle Dogs, three chorizo spiced pork breakfast sausages on sticks dipped in the house waffle batter and fried to a golden brown and dusted with powdered sugar.  Warned that these were hot in temperature but mild in flavor Samantha suggested a combination of maple syrup (not authentic maple, mind you) and hot sauce as a condiment for this and first tasting the Dogs themselves and then with syrup and sauce I had to admit they were better dressed but not terribly impressive either way.  A bit spicy and a nice blend of sweet and savory the overall impression was that yes, this was kind of like a corndog, but without the cornbread and thus inferior.  Light and without oiliness the crispness was appreciated, but overall rather lacking for a \\\"signature\\\" dish.\\n\\nMoving next to my second selection, the better of the two by some degree, a half order of Caramelized banana & pecan French toast was delivered - a dish that would clearly be tasty based simply on ingredients, but actually a nice preparation with the single slice of buttery brioche crisp on the exterior and custard like on the inside topped with fresh bananas, crunchy pecans, and a thick caramel sauce that tasted good on the toast and equally delicious spooned into my coffee.  Certainly not a breakfast for those lacking a sweet tooth one slice was definitely enough, especially after the waffle dogs.\\n\\nWith a coffee offered for the road and the clock just shy of 7:45 I accepted the to-go cup and after paying the admittedly modest tab plus tip made my way from the restaurant en route to clinic along with the newspaper housing and sports sections that I was encouraged to take along with me.

While still being thick and creamy - it was lighter than most, and the hibiscus added the nicest, cleanest flavor. Divine. There was also creme de menthe bread pudding. It tasted really good, and the bread pudding consistency was perfect, but it was a little too rich for both of us.

I haven't felt the urge to try it again yet.\\n\\nThe second time I went was so that I could finally take advantage of their Sunday all-day 2-for-1 breakfast burritos. The basic burrito is scrambled eggs, hash browns, cheddar, and red or green chile for $5.50, but I did the one meat option for $6.50. Yes, that's two for $6.50 at the special price.\\n\\nI tried all the meats, and chorizo is definitely the best, with bacon a reasonable but not so meaty second and the sausage and ham options not really providing anything special that would make me want to order them ever again. I'm probably going to stock up on 6 of these or so one of these days for an entire week of breakfast burrito-y goodness.\\n\\nCarlito's is simply a great, cheap local spot for New Mexican cuisine.

Trader Joe's frozen teriyaki chicken breasts are far superior. The grilled corn was actually grilled and was sweet and delicious.

She died around 10pm last night and we kept calling and gave up around 4am.\\n\\nI had to take out stuff from the standalone freezer in my garage and put my baby in there because I was getting worried about her body decaying before I can find a solution.\\n\\nSorry but that's fucking fucked up.\\n\\nHow do these people run a \\\"compassionate\\\" service that gives your dog \\\"dignity\\\" and \\\"ensures peace of mind\\\" and gives \\\"guidance at any time of need\\\" to owners when I had to resort to putting my dog in a food freezer so she doesn't rot to pieces before I can give her a proper send off?\\n\\nAnd they STILL didn't answer this morning when I called. They open at 8:30am. \\n\\nA vet and a cemetery already called me back, but not these fuckers who claim 24 hour care. \\n\\nI went with the pet cemetery. Not only did they answer, they had compassion referring to my dog as \\\"my baby girl\\\" and had a gentle kind way in her words in explaining what to do so my dog can finally have a rest and you can hear in her voice that she cared when she was telling me \\\"it will be alright\\\" and that \\\"she will help any way she can\\\" when I lost it on the phone and got bawling. She touched my hand and handed me tissues when I started to cry in their office and was fighting back tears of her own. That's all I wanted is for a business to live up to their name and help me get her to rest.\\n\\nWorst damn night of my life getting antsy hoping for a call back. \\n\\nIf you guys answered I would have loved to give you guys double just to \\\"tip\\\" for taking care of us when we need it most. I know your job isn't easy and it's no fun having to go in the middle of the night to pick up corpses, but c'mon it's your business that you chose to have and you guys chose to claim 24 hour services! Run your business right then and please respond to people in a reasonable time!\\n\\nSorry, but if I die in this godforsaken valley, I'm making sure my corpse or my family doesn't land in with you guys. Can't even get my dog dignity, how am I going to trust you with a human?\\n\\nEDIT: So they DID call. Whoop-de-doo. At 6am to my BFs cellphone when we passed out from exhaustion....yeah the BF left a message around 11pm ish so that's quite a long time to call us back . Timely fashion is all we ask for....I know I'm not the only person in this city who had a dog die last night and that the employees need to have a life, but again, you signed up into this industry and advertise a service that was not followed on through. This IS a time sensitive industry. A corpse at 60*F will already smell of decay in 6 hours. If we didn't have a freezer we were going to be ROYALLY FUCKED. She died around 9:30-10pm....8 hours spanned by the time they called us back so she was definitely going to be decayed in my 77*F living room. That's traumatic to put people through...no one wants to see their pet in such a dismal condition.\n"}, {"label": "very positive", "sentence": "Text: This salon has got to be one of the few salons to acquire such nice and wonderful staffs!

The lengua was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nThe service here at Don Jose's was very attentive.  I believe the owners is the man himself and his wife.  They have about 4 sauce selections to choose from.  There was a dark red, a regular tomato/pico de gallo salsa, green salsa, and I forgot what else.  I loved all of them but I'm a huge fan of the green.  The burrito could go without the sauce, but I'm a well known sauce bandit so it was pretty saucey.\\n\\nWith the order, we ordered a California Burrito, Chorizo Burrito, 2 Ham and Egg Breakfast Burrito, and a Sausage and Egg Breakfast Burrito.  I took a bite out of the Chorizo Burrito, it was pretty good.

Unfortunately, the cost for that was a room that was substantially more expensive than what I would have considered similar quality elsewhere in Vegas.\\n\\nThe Luxor was undoubtedly nice at one time, but it feels very much like a has-been that is in need of a new image and a severe remodel.  We were in a room on the first few floors of the pyramid, which was not too terrible.  Despite other comments, the noise from the casino floor wasn't really noticeable.  The view of the atrium is great, though from our room, we had to go down an elevator and then sneak onto an inclinator to get any worthwhile view.\\n\\nHowever, from the Luxor, everything's a major walk.

There's a trick or two in doing that without walking all through the Grand.  Unfortunately, the LV Monorail is a miserable experience in itself, because at most stops, you are forced to walk a long way (often through large shopping areas, or around parking areas, and always through the casino floor) to get from the street to the Monorail.

The beds were out of this world comfy; there were times when I didn't want to get out of bed. The view (at least from the 37th floor) was awesome. \\n\\n-Gambling: I won about $200 on penny slots. Ha! \\n\\n-Clubs: Had such a blast at Tryst and XS; they are the hottest clubs in Vegas right now and you'd be a fool not to check them out. Thanks, Mac, for hooking us up! :) \\n\\n- The fantastic deal we found on Travelocity: $396 (each - 2 people) for 4 nights and airfare. That is just an unbelievable price. \\n\\nThings that did NOT impress me: \\n\\n- The jenky-ass room they first tried to put us in. It was on the 6th floor and overlooking the top of another building. We went up, took one look and said hell no and demanded another room. \\n\\n- There was just not enough places to eat inside the hotel. They had only ONE cheap option which was this little cafe that offered crap. The only other two options were the buffet for $30 a pop and the Terrace Grill which was sit down. \\n\\n- Along those lines, since the Wynn is so new, It didn't feel developed enough for me (e.g. no shopping, not enough food options, etc.) We had to go to Cesar's and The Venetian to really get some good diversity. \\n\\n- It's at the end of the strip so you're not central; I didn't mind this so much but it's definitely something to think about when you're considering a place to stay.

It was probably the most tastefully decorated hotel room I've ever stayed in. Even though the room faced the \\\"wrong\\\" direction (towards the north), it still provided an amazing view. The bed in the room was the best I've ever slept on.

As tacky as it sounds, attention was given to literally every inch of this hotel. Throughout our 3-night stay, we constantly caught new details of each area we passed. It is literally unlike any other place I've been and makes the Venetian/Palazzo look like a tacky mess.\\n\\nThe restaurants: Ate at the Buffet, Le Cave and Tableau. The buffet is probably the best one you can get in vegas. Le Cave was very mediocre. Sunday brunch at Tableau was the best breakfast I've ever had in my life (no exaggeration). Generally, the prices were reasonable by Vegas standards.\\n\\nThe pools: Most of our time was spent at the European pool, which was absolutely great. It has great decor, music, drinks, and a topless-optional policy for the female guests. There is also a quieter family-friendly pool not far away too, which provides a great chance to relax. If you only take one piece of my advice: Avoid the Beach Club like the plague.\\n\\nThe clubs: It's a shame; a lot of time/money was obviously put into developing these clubs, but they are managed extremely poorly (especially regarding security).

We didn't even order off the menu - just told 'em what we liked (I was the only non-beef/pork eater) and they brought us the most amazing and tasty array of apps, salads, pasta (shrimp stuffed chicken - oh YUM), cheesecake - and they have a great wine list as well. Everything I've had there has been over-the-top delicious, and the folks that ate the pork dish said it's the best thing they've ever had. \\n\\nMy suggestion: definitely FAST before you go in - it is NOT the place to diet... \\n\\nThe staff is wonderful as well - it may be located in a strip mall - but don't let that fool you. The first time through the door I thought it was a little \\\"high\\\" priced ($20-$25 average price of entrees from what I remember) - and all it took was the first bite for me to realize it wasn't overpriced - AT ALL. TRY IT. You won't regret it. I'm a HUGE fan - I'm a little afraid to try the new location - just because I don't think the Southern Highlands locale can be beat - but I might have to do that on the next trip to town. \\n\\nEnjoy!!!!!\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Text: I bough an Amazon Local back in January of 2014, booked an appt. in March because she was booked out.

I told her I was disturbed that I was charged for this without asking and asked why and she said, \\\"Well obviously...somebody as in our minibar department went into your room or it was just a mistaken room number ...or anything could have happened. But we'll get it sorted out for you.\\\" I said, \\\"OK Please do\\\" and guessed that was the end of it.  I also wasn't very satisfied with the \\\"anything could have happened\\\" explanation. \\n\\nTo me this is quite sneaky to charge a customer's credit card in this fashion without consent and explanation. It's not like they don't have my e-mail and/or phone number to inform me of the charge. That's dishonest. My guess would also be an integrity issue again with the Hotel Valley Ho staff for missing liquor. \\n\\nI was never reimbursed.  I call back AGAIN 3 weeks later and Brian said that he would take my name and number and call me back with information. The same Brian called me back a half hour later and abruptly asked, \\\"What was the issue?\\\" and in a somewhat curt tone. I explained the situation again and told him the charges were supposed to be reversed and weren't. He then said in a snarky fashion, \\\"Fine, if you didn't take it home with you then I'll reimburse it to your Visa.\\\" At this point I'm really angry as he said it in tone implying that I might be lying about it. Nice way to treat your customers. \\n\\nWell, guess what? Yea, Brian never reversed the charges. Twice they said they would reverse the charges and didn't; feels really dishonest at this point. It's only $50 bucks but to me it's the principle of the continued dishonesty and then having to spend 20 minutes more on the phone with my bank filing a \\\"charge dispute\\\" was time consuming and once again irritating.

And it was one such reader that led me to Delmonico recently for what he claimed to be an excellent burger. He's a food writer in town so he should know what he's talking about, right?\\n\\nDelmonico is located in the small restaurant row of the Venetian right by another great burger spot, although most people would not come here for their burger. The interior is nothing too fancy in either the bar area or more traditional area in the back. I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for.\\n\\nThe Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes on a toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese and bacon. The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly.\\n\\nLuckily the fries were great. Some of them were almost a bit too hard and crunchy, but they were very tasty and a welcome change to the 'typical' fries I often get around town. Something I found to be quite funny was when I asked for ketchup I was brought an insanely large bowl of it, more than probably a table full of people could have used.\\n\\nThe online menu lists the burger at $15, so I was a little surprised to see the $18 listed on the menu when I made my order.

A little ironic, we thought.\\n\\nI asked if there was anything the chef was recommending tonight, what was the special. Bartender didn't know - she had to go ask. She came back and said the special tonight was the sword fish. My husband decided on the shrimp scampi. Took FOREVER to be served. The sword fish had sort of a soapy-smarmy taste to it.

Interesting ... that's their money-maker (at $7/glass) isn't it?\\n\\nWe had to ask for our bill 3 times. Apparently emptying/filling the dishwasher was more important. When it finally got to us, I noted that the \\\"special\\\" swordfish on the bill was listed at the same price as on the menu, even though it was marked on the bill (and told to us beforehand) as The Special. (Usually doesn't that mean it's discounted a buck or two? My fault, I should have asked prior.) The bartender offered to go ask, I said no, that's fine, we have to get going. She still went and asked anyway. 5 minutes later, she came back and said the manager said that's the price, special just means it's something special the chef makes.

We got there a bit early to have a beer and chill at the bar. Happy hour was going on, so 2 pints of beer was $6-- score! The tour started, and our guide gave us a little history about the place in the courtyard. We went back inside and had 3 beer samples (about 8-10oz each), a pierogi and a soft pretzel.

It was great to have at least one educational tour on the Trolley, and the owner did a fantastic job answering all of our questions. I'm definitely a fan! We all got back in the Trolley which dropped everyone back off at Penn Brewery.\\n\\nAll in all, it was well worth the $75/person for the tour.

Agadashi Tofu (Lightly cooked tofu served in tempura sauce with bonito)  -  This dish was a little bland, you'd think that since tofu doesn't have much flavor...the majority of the flavor would be in the sauce.

The food is fine, not great, and reasonably priced - a frustration when you know the quality produce that is getting pounded out left right and centre on the 1st floor.

But you need to make sure that these guys understand the basics of service. For example, if I order a beer at the bar and am told to take a seat and somebody will bring it over, then I don't expect it to take over 10 minutes to come. I also expect seasoned bar tenders to be able to deal with more than one order at a time. If you are offering table service, then make sure I get checked back on, and maybe offer me another beer before this one runs out, it's basic service. Finally, if you tell me I am ok to run a tab then make sure the bill is correct at the end of the night, my most recent visit was borderline attempted theft as the sheer volume of rogue drinks and 'double entries' on a bill which should have been a couple bottles of wine and a handful of pints was arguably more than just human error.\\n\\nLike I said, a good concept, poorly executed.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Text: Service was just fine in this family friendly restaurant i.e. entrees in plastic baskets, condiments in paper cups etc \\n\\nThe menu would benefit greatly from a few more healthy entree options - more salads - maybe a nightly fish special that isn't deep fried?  \\n\\nWe ordered the Beer Boiled Shrimp entree, the Cod Sandwich, Chicken Tenders for the kids, a basket of fries, the Wedge Salad and your Bean and Sausage soup of the night..oh and the cheese curds, because we're Wisconsinites.

My \\\"Nachos Supreme\\\" was basically movie theater nachos. Chips, and nacho cheese. Literally the cheese you get with your theater chips, or that you dip your soft pretzels in. So much of it, in fact, I couldn't see chips in there at first. Where's the Supreme? Sure, there were a couple pieces of tomato in there, some black olives, and massive chunks of chicken that were completely illogical to eat in one bite since they were roughly the size of the chip itself. Has this restaurant ever SEEN a real plate of nachos?

My experience today is rather typical. I go in and order at sandwich to carry out at about 2:30pm. So it's after the lunch rush and not extremely busy. And I wait for 14 minutes for my sandwich!! While I'm waiting I start to fume a bit as I make some observations. I count NINE employees currently working (and maybe more in the back I couldn't see). That's a heck of a lot of staff for a soup and sandwich shop with no table service that isn't even that busy. \\n\\nBut here's the real kicker: I counted SEVEN tickets while I was waiting. That means there were two more people working than there were orders, and it still took me 14 minutes to get a sandwich. There is something very wrong with that. Most of the problem was obvious, the majority of the staff seemed to be wandering around behind the counter not exactly sure what they were doing, not at a particular assigned station, and moving really quite slowly on whatever task they were attempting to figure out. It's sandwiches, not haute cuisine. It should be fast, efficient, and good. And just because the staff looked mostly like college kids and 20 somethings is no excuse. The campus pub I used to work at was all 19year olds in the kitchen and with a little training, three of them could crank out solid food at about five times the rate of Eat Unique with a much more complex menu including a flattop and fryer. \\n\\nMy suggestion to the owners/managers: fire half your staff (which should allow you to lower your prices), and get 3-4 solid line cooks that know what they're doing and how to work in a kitchen.

Haven't been too many places recently.\\n\\nI was headed to a local lunch spot downtown earlier than usual due to a 12:30 meeting (12:30? seriously?) and this was the first place we found that was serving lunch to the 1st lunch period crowd (remember those poor kids in elementary school that pulled the short straw and ate lunch at 11 AM - that was us that day).\\n\\nNow I am not a drinker.  My dog imbibes more than I do, so the beer list was kind of lost on me (besides, I always think it is bad mojo to go into a meeting after lunch and wreak of anything, especially alcohol).\\n\\nMy CW and I were the first to be seated - maybe that was our mistake.  She ordered the quiche of the day and I ordered a sirloin burger w/ sweet potato fries.\\n\\nHer salad was okay.  Nice greens although not much else going on in it.\\n\\nFrom there, it went straight downhill.  When CW's quiche arrived, it was lovely to look at - leeks and andouille sausage - and cold.  Not warm, not cooler than you would prefer. It was flipping cold.  So she explained that to the waiter who took it back.  Then she waited and waited and waited.  Expecting it to be nuked, this was taking quite a while.\\n\\nWhen he brought the plate out, it was a new piece of quiche - he explained that when they tried to heat up the original piece, it crumbled so they made a new quiche.  As a former waitstaff (waitress but trying to be PC here), I would have stayed around and made sure that this piece was more to her liking. But he bolted. And - you guessed - this piece was equally as bad.\\n\\nNow I know - you are going to say she was picky.  But I actually touched the quiche to allay my fears and it was flipping cold.  My guess? The quiches were either chilled or frozen and they didn't know how to reheat them.  She ended up with a 1/2 of a chicken salad panini with dried cherries although I will be darned if there were any dried cherries in it.  So CW is going vote this bistro off the island.\\n\\nMy lunch?  I ordered the Brew-a-Burger Sirloin rare.  When it came, I don't think it was much warmer than CW's quiche - yes, I order it rare and expect the inside to be warm but I also expect the outside to be hot which it wasn't.  The cheese sat on the top and never softened, let alone melted.  I also expect a rare burger to be flavorful without the addition of much else - and it wasn't.  About 1/2 way through, I almost wondered if they had given me a ground chicken burger in error.  At that point, I figured it was not worth pursuing. \\n\\nShould they have given CW a free lunch?  Or a GC for a free lunch upon a return visit?  Doesn't matter what they should have done as they did nothing - the bill arrived and was paid as expected.\\n\\nAll in all, it was not a great food experience.  I don't think we will be returning for lunch anytime soon. Was it a bad day for the kitchen?  Did we arrive before they were really ready to serve lunch?  Not sure but, either way, when you spend $25 plus tip for lunch, I think there are better places to drop it.

I would have to classify it as indifferent efficiency.  However, that being said, I wanted to order something not on the menu and worked with them and they had it and they asked me if it was the way I liked it. Also it was not too busy.\\n\\nc.

Let's get ready to rock it.\\n\\n- Rock Cod steamed - This s essentially a key fish in cantonese cuisine, at least in my book.  The rock cod themselves have rather large bones and is perfect to steam. The meat is just the right texture and when you add the scallion, oil and soy sauce, the smell, the taste, the natural sauce, it is absolutely the best.\\n\\n- Bitter Melon with spare ribs in black bean sauce - Now listen here all, you know you are in a great place if they serve bitter melon. How many people would normally order bitter melon.  If this was served at Panda, it would never be sold. but here, my goodness, it was great. The melon was just right, firm, not crunchy.

I asked the waitress if they had this after I attempted to describe it and she knew exactly what I wanted and they brought it out.  The half chicken order was perfect. Tons of shredded scallion on top of the chicken that had a very thin layer of skin which means, awesome tasting proper chicken baby!  Yep, the best chicken for this is the not so thick and meaty chicken, but the bony rather emaciated chicken that have a wonderful taste. This dish was just perfect and I had to have extra ginger sauce as it was so good. \\n\\nd.

You shovel the rice from a bowl into your mouth with chopsticks. You do NOT try to pick the rice up, you are NOT dainty, you are NOT polite.  You SHOVEL the morsels of rice into your mouth.  By the way, no soy sauce on the rice.  When you are eating Cantonese style, you are putting the food in your plate or your rice bowl and the fragrant and tasty juices of the dishes are absorbed by your rice. Much tastier than soy sauce.\\n\\n- The Boney Plates.  Yeah, not \\\"china\\\" plates but BONEY plates. Yep, true Cantonese people love their meats on the bone.  The bonier the better.  You will hear some sucking and some crunching, gnawing and jawing, however, the best visual is a plate piled with bones stripped clean like a piranha attacked it!\\n\\n- Oh yeah, no silverware.  Come on.  How can anyone eat Cantonese with a fork and knife is beyond me.  BTW, isn't it funny to see so many people at other restaurants eating Chinese food on an american style plate trying to use a chopstick?   I use silverware when eating in Chinese restaurants that do not have bowls.  Shovel method.  That is the way to go!\\n\\nGK says, check this place out.

I am the type of person that has to try it myself to believe it.  However, in this case the reviews that reflect the 2 Star rating are extremely accurate. \\n\\nThey had half priced appetizers.  We had an order of the Red Neck Tacos.  Pulled Pork with Jalapeno slaw over corn cakes.  These were probably the best thing we ordered.  Although the Pulled Pork was much like my main order, see below..\\n\\nHad 3 Meat meal with Pulled Pork, Brisket and Baby Backs. Baby Backs are a 1/4 slab.  It came with 4.  So I had to research to learn that a Full Slab is considered about 16 Ribs.  However, these were very small, for whatever that is worth.  Another friend had 3 Meat with Chicken.  In all cases, the four available meat choices were dry and over cooked. Baby Backs, the meat was falling off the bone - over cooked. The rub was extremely salty and overpowered any meat taste, smoke taste and BBQ Sauce.  Brisket, dry.  Chicken, dry, Pulled Pork was probably the best of the 4 meats - dry.  The BBQ sauces are lacking.  One that I still don't know what it was supposed to be, another a little spicier and there regular. \\n\\nA third friend stuck with his own order of Red Neck Tacos and then a side of Mac & Cheese.  This side was really pretty good.  Maybe the second best thing we had. \\n\\nI was extremely disappointed.\\n\\nIt is not open for lunch, which is maybe the only other time I might try to return for a sandwich.  Otherwise, there are way too many other locations that serve better BBQ than this. \\n\\nIf you are thinking about it, don't do what I do... Trust some of the reviews and maybe move on.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Text: Not really a friendly \\\"customer service\\\" oriented type of gym.  Not responsive to members requests.

I went with the Wolf Pack, which was 2 eggs, bacon, cheese and covered in hash browns. It was okay, i probably wouldn't order it again. The hashbrowns were soft and definitely needed more time on the griddle. We also split a malted waffle that was one of the best waffles I've ever had, awesome!

Santa Fe Station is the closest casino to my house so I was elated when I heard a sushi restaurant was coming in (even though i loved the pan roasts from Tides- the restaurant it replaced.) The hubby and I have tried this place twice hoping that the 2nd time might change our minds but nonetheless it sucked big time.\\n\\nOur first visit was on a fairly busy Friday night yet we were seated at a table shortly after giving our name. We had a server that was really sweet, yet very busy. We ordered a couple of standard rolls and 1 specialty roll. I will admit the presentation was beautiful, but the taste was mediocre at best. The volcano roll had some extra ingredients that weren't listed on the menu and my hubby refused to eat more than the first bite of it. Unlike the previous restaurant that was located here, there is not a full bar, only sake choices- which also disappointed us. The worst part is that after our 3 rolls and 2 glasses of tea/soda our $60 bill was given to us, but never picked up. We literally sat there for 20 minutes trying to get the servers attention until we finally got up and walked over to the hostess station to pay our bill. \\n\\nOur 2nd visit was much worse. This time we got there pretty early on a Saturday night. They had many tables open (which should have been a warning) and we were seated almost immediately. We ordered 3 specialty rolls an iced tea and a soda. We got our first roll after about 30 minutes. Our limited-English speaking server came by to obnoxiously apologize 15 times in between getting our 3 rolls delivered over the course of 2 hours. The place was not even busy and it took them 2 effin hours to make 3 rolls????? We weren't full after the 3 rolls, but didn't have all night to stay for more. Of course I wasted no time getting our check this time because I knew the routine and walked right up to the hostess station to demand it. \\n\\nI predict this place will close very soon.

We were then told that the menus are different depending on where you sit and I still mentioned that outdoors was fine for the group.  We were seated and guess what - there was the 'other menu' that was only for the indoors guest.

Dinner reservations were at 6pm (I always expect incompetence) and our show was at 9:30pm.  Well, this \\\"Spago\\\" place had us waiting for our meals for over 1 HOUR.  Meanwhile our unattentive, incompetent waiter AND owner did not even come by our table to explain to us what the issue was (if there was any issue).

It looked spicy as described on the menu but didn't have much of a kick.  She should have ordered something that said Rick Moonen in front of it because the Cioppino was excellent and recommended as a fan of seafood.  We tried the Ahi Tuna Duo for an appetizer that was so-so and the Key Lime pie for desert which was meh (both off the prix fixe menu).

Unlike my previous reference to their prices from nearly ten years ago, these prices have changed within the last year - seemingly overnight, as they moved from the Steptoe location to the Dean Martin facility.\\n\\nNext up are their restrictions. These aren't all that new, since they used to enforce them quite a lot at the old location, but they've always been a thorn in my side when visiting. I understand the safety aspect of it when they're watching over newbies, but if someone with the necessary skills has signed the death waiver releasing all liability from the company, why not let them do some double/consecutive flips? They don't even allow double flips into the Foam Zone, which essentially has a very minimal risk of injury, even when landing on your head. You can't even do a single flip on the SkySlam court, which makes it much less desirable to go on - I can't even live out my dream of being a SlamBall pro! =P\\n\\nIn my opinion, there has to be a better way to track this. Maybe have a tiered skillset classification, where newbies use the orange jump-time stickers, but skilled jumpers receive green stickers. Your system profile determines which one prints out of the computer, and it only gets updated at your request and the approval of a SkyZone employee who has witnessed and verified that you are, in fact, capable of more than just one flip at a time. Untrained people can be paralyzed by trying a single flip and landing in the wrong position, but that reasoning doesn't stop Sky Zone from letting patrons do single flips. Why set the restriction level at double/consecutive flips, then?\\n\\nOverall, I'm glad the location is closer to home, and I won't have to drive as far, but Sky Zone shouldn't have raised their prices as much as they did, especially since they can support a higher volume of customers at their new location. With all the courts they have now, they should also be able to set one aside for big-kid tricks like double and consecutive flips, without restriction. As a final note, I can at least reflect positively on the dodgeball courts. Games are quick and exhausting, providing a great workout. They separate the games into age groups, so the younger kids won't have to worry about being pushed around by the adults/teenagers.\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Text: To put this review in context, I was looking for a meal in the same vein as Ruth's Chris's or Morton's steakhouse.  Having eaten at Houston's (in Houston), I thought this would be a great place to get a steak.  I was probably shooting a little high.  Service was good, but there were issues with the food.  First off they ran out of baked potatoes, not a big deal but perhaps a little foreshadowing?  The Steak came out with no red in the center, probably a solid medium.  The redone steak came out a little more pink (not red), but still did not have the deep, meaty flavor I was craving.  The Fish sandwich we ordered was good, as were the cole slaw and broccoli sides.  In other words, I would come back here for lunch (the fish sandwich), but not the steak.  I can't comment on the sushi, maybe this is what they are concentrating on.

I have been to Lux countless times over the last few years. It has always been the place to see and be seen, with coffee service that is definitely above Starbucks, but I will admit struggles in certain areas. \\n\\nLux, in its former space, was a small shop, always packed and definitely had its crowd. If you weren't a part of the crowd, you'd receive a \\\"look\\\" of, \\\"hey, who are you?!\\\" Look past that and hop in line for a cappuccino and it would make up for it.\\n\\nThe new space, well... it caters to the exclusivity of the \\\"hipster\\\" crowd. Walk through the door that you THINK is the entrance... and wander around. The kitchen, espresso bar and cocktail bar are all broken up and there is no definitive flow of service. Also, is that a customer wearing the tight jeans and cardigan? Or is that the staff? Who knows? Luckily I have a friend who works there and was kind enough to show me around and how the flow of service works. If you're not that lucky, best of luck to you, as you're left to your own sense of direction as how to order, sit down, etc. From what I gather, you can order an espresso drink and sit wherever and they'll call your name when your drink is ready. However, I'm not sure about the cocktail bar. The only way I think you would order would be by sitting at the bar? Not sure about ordering food from the kitchen.\\n\\nI will admit, I haven't ordered any food from Lux yet, apart from a pastry for my coffee. I had a croissant, which was pretty good and went really well with my cappuccino. I'm a fan of a free-pour cappuccino, however the cappuccino that I was served on this visit had the foam scooped on top. This confused me, because I saw other customers order a cappuccino and get one free-pour. Maybe it depends on the barista? Kind of inconsistent. I did sit down at the awkward cocktail bar and order a drink. The bar has normal height seating and a raised bar for the bartender. It's awkward when they lean down and tower over you to deliver a drink. Anyway, I ordered the \\\"Number 47\\\" cocktail with gin, Green Chartreuse, St. Germain, lime, mint and cucumber. I'm a huge fan of Green Chartreuse and gin so I was excited to try it. They didn't have any cucumber in house, so they made it without it. Jeff (the owner) commented, \\\"Well today it's just the 46.\\\" Hmm... Alright. So I took a sip of the cocktail. It was decent. Nothing exciting at all. It was overpowered by the mint and the lime in the cocktail. It masked the green Chartreuse too much. It really NEEDED that cucumber to mellow out the mint and lime so you could taste all of the ingredients.\\n\\nOh well... what can you do when the owner doesn't seem to mind that ingredients are missing? \\n\\nOverall, props to Lux for being busy at 3pm on a Thursday afternoon and being a successful establishment, which may be from the same established clientele from before the expansion. The coffee and pastry has remained the same, which is ok with me. However, the cocktail bar tries a little too hard, I think. Also, the decor and vibe has definitely turned Lux into the \\\"hipster mecca\\\" and excluded the general public from it's demographic. Which, I can't complain or comment too much, because they are doing just fine. The flow of the restaurant is choppy and confusing and the staff is less than considerate (with a few exceptions).

Seeing that some of my trusted Yelp buddies have already done a review on this place, I would say the decision to come here was a good one. With that said, I just found it ok. I may not agree with the reviews, but I respect their opinions.\\n\\nFirst off, the prices here are a bit lower than what you would find at a higher end seafood place so that's a good start. Their menu options are pretty simple to understand. I opted for the Tilapia Cajun style. Comes with Cole Slaw and one side so I opted for Kale Salad. Im not into Cole Slaw so I substituted it for Grilled Veggies, which was a dollar more. My wife went with the Seared Ahi Cajun style with Kale Salad and substituted Brown Rice for yet another dollar more. \\n\\nThe Tilapia was decent. It was nice and flaky but I thought it could of used more seasoning. Since I had it Cajun style, I was expecting a bit of a kick to it, which I found none of. The grilled veggies were really good. You got sliced carrots and red bell peppers cooked just right with that little bit of crispiness to it. My wife's Seared Ahi was just ok. Again, hardly any of the Cajun flavor was evident. The Brown Rice was just ok.\\n\\nNotice I didn't mention the Kale Salad. It's because that salad is worthy of it's own paragraph! Now I have never been much of salad eater and when I do, kale is definitely not my first choice but after experiencing it here I was hooked! Their Kale Salad by itself is worthy of a 5 star rating. From what I recall, it had sliced strawberries, almonds and carrots. As for the dressing, it had a strawberry infused poppy seed vinaigrette type of taste to it. I kid you not if this was all I had for lunch or dinner I would be satisfied! So whatever you get here, make sure the Kale Salad is a part of it or your trip is going to be a waste!\\n\\nBecause of the tasty Kale Salad, that is what prevented me from giving this place 2 stars instead of 3. Why you ask? Well I am spoiled by my favorite fish place called California Fish Grill that has several locations in Southern California. Memo to the owner: Check these guys out and you will know what you are dealing with. Their prices are a bit cheaper, the portions are a bit more, and when you get the Cajun style flavor, you actually get the spicy kick you are looking for. You also get different salsas you can put on your fish at no additional charge. \\n\\nSo overall, I still need to find a place that is comparable to my favorite place in California. But for awesome Kale Salad, this is my go to place.\\n\\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #2\n"}, {"label": "negative", "sentence": "Text: I love beer gardens, and I love beer.

We were actually seated at Steak N Shake and we had this epiphany that we should go get sushi instead. So we got up and drove all the way up the I-15 to Osaka.\\n\\nWhen you enter, you're greeted by a blank wall. What is this - a Japanese Speakeasy? You then turn right and go through another door that takes you to a small sushi bar area. From this initial view, you'd think the place was tiny. If you continue to the back and left, though, you discover that the place can seat quite a lot of people. They have a Teppanyaki area and a surprising number of private booths and traditional looking Japanese sunken dining tables. The space is very aesthetically pleasing.\\n\\nUnfortunately, when it came to the food, I was disappointed. I really wasn't that hungry, but I tried everything that my cousin ordered. We stuck to their late night special menu that is available 10pm-2am.\\n\\n* Beef Tataki Salad - It looked amazing, but it lacked flavor. I think I've only ever had Beef Tataki at Ichiza and theirs runs circles around Osaka's.\\n* King Crab Tempura - This was easily the best thing we ordered. Delicious.\\n* Salmon Skin (half) Roll - This also lacked flavor. I'm kind of a purist in that I like to eat sushi exactly how the chef made it. I never use soy sauce or add wasabi. I stuck to my guns on this, despite the roll really needing the extra flavor.\\n* Screaming Orgasm (ahi sashimi on top of some salad) - This also looked amazing. It had better flavor than the Beef Tataki, but I wasn't blown away by it. The dressing was a little too vinegary.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the service was excellent. The two ladies that served us were extremely friendly and attentive to our needs. The green tea tasted great and was the perfect thing on my still recovering throat. Whenever I was running low on tea, the lady would come back and top it off promptly.\\n\\nI really hate giving less than three stars, but I must stay true to the rating system.

DO NOT STAY AT THE MANDALAY BAy. We went to Vegas on Saturday 4-19-2014 weekened, and went straight to our room on the 10th floow room 305. To our surprise the 2 queen size beds were actually full sizes. Not a big issue but then when one of our friends laid on the bed, she noticed that there was potato chips and pinapple chunks behind the pillow. We tried calling front desk, but the phones were disconnected. We had to go back down to the lobby to resolve the issue.They reconnected our phones and send some cleaners to replace the sheets and pillows but told us that their queen size beds were of that size. later on, when we went to use the bathroom, the bathroom had 2 huge moths flying around. We manage to killed them but that left a huge guts splatter on the wall. Turning on the bathroom lights, shorted out the circuit and the lights either flicker or died out for minutes at times. Calling the front desk again, they acknowledge that the bathroom lights were crappy and ask us to use the breakers. They later send in a few \\\"engineers\\\" to look at the issues and a \\\"manager\\\" came and look at the bug splatters of the moths we killed. The engineers acknowledge that the lights were faulty and the months might had gotten in through the ducts while the manager just came, look around at the dead bugs and left. The TV also kept switching from power saving mode and normal mode which was annoying when watching the games. The walls are also pretty thin, we can hear the TV from one of the rooms next door and laughter from the opposite wall.\\n\\nWent to lights, we had 3 tables books across our various friends that went. the floor was so nasty that I thought I had step on gum the entire night only to find my shoes to be bum free. thats when we realized that the floors were the issue. Each step was like stepping on glue. The rails of the stairs leading to our tables upstairs werent very santizing either. For $1500 for a table, that's $4500 for 3 and so not worth it. Prices for drinks were also high as well. Close to 50 bucks for 3 shots of goose, thats pretty much more expensive then a bottle of goose itself. The only thing that save the night was Alesso being an awesome DJ.\\n\\nOn sunday, we ordered breakfast and the pricing was ridiculous. 3 plates of steak and eggs with bacons cost $50.00. To add insult, we notice that they charged us $60 something and ask why there was additional charges in which they reply, the utentials and the table cloths is what those charges are. WHO charges $10+ for utensials!!! The egg was over cook, the bacon were rubbery.\\n\\nNot only were our room dirty, the electricty was working on and off, bugs everywhere and Mandalay Bay doesn't really give a crap about their customers. Our friends in another room who booked 2 queen with a couch bed was given a 2 queen with no couch bed.

Words hardly exist to describe our experience at this place.\\n\\nThis was the third place on the list for our limo to take our bachelorette party, because I'd heard that it was only to be visited while trashed. Also, they had a mechanical bull. Additional bonus: I was told we were likely to be the hottest people in the place. \\n\\nHow could this go wrong? Well, being the hottest group in a place is simply not all it's cracked up to be. Other reviewers mention being completely freaked out by everyone around them - this is entirely true, and a diplomatic way of saying that beer goggles cast no positive light on the ugly mugs surrounding you.\\n\\nI'm all about the common person getting their party on. But the common folks as a group usually include some average people, some below-average, and some above-average. The crowd at this place made it seem like there were bouncers at the door who kept out anyone who looked average or better.\\n\\nOur group came in costume - 80's clothes from the Prince era - and when we might've looked like a hot mess at other places, we somehow didn't stick out at all in this joint. \\n\\nCreepy men - ones old enough to be my dad - asked me to dance and actually proposed to me on the dance floor. One guy with such heavy vodka breath practically spit all over me on the dance floor and incorporated a move I've never experienced before - he grabbed my glowstick necklace with his teeth and shook it around like a dog with a bone.\\n\\nThe \\\"normal\\\" people were kind of like folks you'd see at a work function or company picnic - in khaki pants with pleats down the front and tucked-in polo shirts and cell phone holsters on their belts.\\n\\nThe 80's room dance floor is shaped like a circle and has 2 cages. When they're populated, they're usually up to some silly over-the-top 80's or 70's dance moves. It is really fun when some strange people are totally into it and have the \\\"up with people\\\" vibe with such enthusiasm. Think of a dance floor full of girls like the \\\"Flight of the Conchords\\\" biggest fan.\\n\\nIt's about as harmless as a gay bar in there, except that's where I was proposed to, so you do have to have a sense of humor. The wierdest part is the 50 year-olds, with very bad fashion sense, booty-dancing with each other. There was also a man who looked to be about sixty who was spastically running in place in a cowboy hat and tennis shoes while his face went through epileptic siezures. Many folks like this were there - people who decided they would be \\\"hip\\\" by wearing John Lennon sunglasses with reflective lenses or something. If you stand too close, one of them will fixate on you and begin dancing in your direction.\\n\\nThe hip-hop room is a rectangular room with four cages on each corner. An orgy was occurring in one of the cages. Three girls who looked like they were from Scottsdale (somewhat thin, in designer jeans and holding Gucci bags) decided to go ASAP - As Slutty As Possible - and grind on each other in the cage. This was going as you'd pretty much expect, until it took a turn for the worse.\\n\\nA tall white-trashy looking girl, who looked like a very cheap stripper, was hanging out below the cage. She had long wavy, frizzy blond hair and glasses, and was wearing an uber-short pleated skirt and black tank that showed her midriff, and a thong. She decided to reach her arm into the cage and started rubbing one of the girls' crotches over her jeans from behind, before she decided to jump into the cage.\\n\\nShe jumped in the cage and began VERY aggressively grinding/bucking on the girls - because she was so much taller than them, they were easily pushed around. I watched one of the Scottsdale girls talking to her friend about \\\"How to get out of this\\\" while she was being essentially banged from behind by the stripper chick. They were knocking into each other, stumbling like dominoes in the cage.\\n\\nAt some point, the Scottsdale girls reluctantly and slowly caved in until the stripper chick threw one girl's back up against the wall and started jackhammering her like a dog on a leg. By now, the cage was surrounded by guys who could no longer keep it together, and hands started reaching through the cage and grabbing anything they could grab.\\n\\nThis scene continued on for about 20 minutes and escalated until a large body builder guy with a shaved head jumped in and took off his shirt and sandwiched himself between them all. He had a large asian-font tattoo across his back that said \\\"JESUS.\\\"\\n\\nSecurity showed up to break it up ... only because the guy had taken off his shirt.\\n\\nMy friends were propositioned by dad-aged men, some of whom would invite them home by standing behind them and staring, wordlessly touching their arm repeatedly until the bar closed. Since it seemed so normal, it made me wonder if it's also normal there for a girl to respond by jumping in the stranger's car after the last song.\\n\\nIt was more like an anthropological experiment than a normal night out on the town.

Opened by a former employee of Lotus of Siam, this place was on his immediate \\\"need to go\\\" list. So we went on opening day and I believe we were one of their first customers in the restaurant.  (FYI - John Curtas just edged in before us.).\\n\\nNow let me get this straight - I'm a little leery when someone tells me it's a \\\"tapas\\\" place. Because my brain translates this to - \\\"we're going to give you 50% less food  but only reduce the price by 20% so you can 'share' and try more things.\\\" It's a FOS total cash grab marketing scheme of which Chada Thai is no exception. We ordered approximately 10 items for 3 people (including two $1 bowls of  rice which they charged extra for) which ended up being about $82.16 pre-tip and left the restaurant hungry. Yeah - we left f&(king hungry and s&*ting gold f&*king bricks afterwards.\\n\\nWe ordered two vegetable dishes - a grilled eggplant dish and a stir-fried mushroom dish. The grilled eggplant ($8) consisted on half of an eggplant marinated in kind of a green papaya salad type dressing. The flavor combination was nice however the grilled eggplant was a little bit tough texturally. The stir-fried mushrooms ($8) consistent of 2-3 different mushrooms with a sliver of lotus root and 1 brussel sprout mixed in. You heard me -1 brussel sprout. There was too little wok hai to the dish and hence the dish was swimming in too much liquid. The flavor was alright but nothing special.\\n\\nThe braised pork belly ($8) had a nice melt in your mouth texture and good flavor. However there were only 5 small slices of meat to go around.\\n\\nThe kai tod (garlic fried chicken) was good ($10) and one of the surprisingly more reasonably priced items on the menu. They actually gave you a large portion of the cornish game hen. The meat itself was tender while the outside was crispy and well seasoned.\\n\\nPad see ew ($6) was one of their better dishes of the night - good flavor with some good crisping of the rice noodles. Their pad thai ($7) though was one of the worst dishes. It was a little unusual for the rice noodle dish to be completely encased in a omelet but we went with it. The omelet was a little bit tough from the overcooked egg while the noodles were completely bland. Not recommended.\\n\\nWe also ordered the steamed sea bass with the plum sauce ($18) which I found to be a little too sweet for my tastes. I would not order this again.\\n\\nMassaman curry ($9) had a nice flavor however was devoid of any real amount of vegetables or meat in the stew. Literally 2 chicken drumsticks, half of a raw small potato and perhaps half an onion.\\n\\nOh and about that raw potato -- so we informed the manager/owner? that the potato in the dish was raw. His response - \\\"but the chicken is cooked, right?\\\". \\\"Yes.\\\" And that was it. He did not offer to correct the problem or even acknowledged that it was an issue at all as long as the chicken was cooked.  He didn't even offer an apology for incorrectly cooked food.

I LOVE TASTING MENUS! Absolutely my favorite thing - I could eat little food forever and be completely happy as I prefer lots of small bites of different interesting things over a gigantic steak/starch/vegetable plate. So, this restaurant is really made for me.

It was crisp and refreshing.\\n\\nMy first course was a play on a caprese - tomato sorbet, tomato \\\"pate\\\", basil leaves, a balsamic reduction, and a few shavings of cheese... this dish was okay. The presentation was beautiful and the elements tasted good, but there was way more tomato with just a few scraps of cheese and then these huge basil leaves. \\n\\nThat said, my husband's dish, which was a seafood soup, was AMAZING! It strongly reminded us of a delicious \\\"she-crab\\\" soup that we had had at an upscale \\\"low country\\\" restaurant in Vegas (now closed, sadly) \\n\\nMy second course was Littleneck clams with a shiso broth, eggplant, and shishito pepper. My husband had shrimp that were delicious as well. \\n\\nThe next course was softshell crab - it was pretty simply presented (I honestly can't even remember what came with it) The legs were the best part as they were crispy! It was a bit funny because the server described the crab by saying that \\\"HE is served with\\\"... made me a little sad to eat the little guy :) \\n\\nI had braised pork cheek for the next course, which was hands down my favorite course of the meal - super savory and flavorful. My husband had fried sweetbreads, which he said were a bit overdone - he didn't get much flavor other than \\\"fried\\\". \\n\\nWe had a fish course, which was okay - he had seared ahi tuna, I had a flaky white fish (cannot remember the name!!) \\n\\nOur meat course was interesting - hubby had the kangaroo prepared with ginger sauce - it was definitely a tougher meat, which is to be expected considering the animal. The flavor was sweet and very unique. It reminded me of elk or venison. I had the New York Strip served with a risotto. The steak was tasty but a VERY small portion 2 slices of 2\\\" x 1/2\\\" x 1/4\\\" (remember, I like small portions! This was just a bit too small -when you are serving wagyu or kobe beef that are very rich with fat, it makes sense to serve a tiny portion, but with regular beef, there's not a good reason to be so skimpy!) \\n\\nThe desserts were just okay - a dulce de leche flan and a white chocolate mousse with a raspberry gelee. They tasted well enough, but they weren't really up my ally texturally - both were very mushy and neither had anything crunchy/crispy/cookie-y with them. \\n\\nI ordered a mocktail at the start of the meal - a fruity pomegranate soda. It was good - very sweet, but good. However, one of my first dishes included a garlic chip, which the server had described as a sunchoke chip. I took a large bite of it, and while I don't mind garlic, it meant that I was tasting garlic for the entire rest of the meal! I had a hard time drinking the very sweet soda as it didn't combine well with the garlic flavor. Also, a warning - three of our dishes included garlic chips of some sort. \\n\\nNow, this last bit will sound nitpicky and weird, but it totally impacted my experience: the silverware is really BIG! This made it difficult to compose dainty bites with various elements from the dishes, and was especially weird considering how petite the food is in general. \\n\\nSo, all that said, I did really enjoy our meal! It is a lovely restaurant and the service was great! The food was pretty good and the surprise of each course made it lots of fun.

After 15 minutes the oven door is quickly opened, the potatoes are quickly covered with the oil, 15 minutes later the door is again opened and the potatoes are turned over.\\n\\nSo 45 minutes pass, what comes out is a potato that is golden brown on the outside with a crispness to it while inside the potato is light and fluffy.... And totally ignored by everyone ! Heretics !\\n\\nThat is until the father in law becomes brave and decides to try one of these strange things his new son in law has produced.... Or it could of been his daughter kicking him under the table while not so subtly nodding at the bowl of potatoes, but he tries one, then ever so slowly reaches over and grabs the bowl and shovels a bunch of them on to his plate, the family is shocked, the strange new food is a hit with the old man, the Brit sits back with a little smile on his face.\\n\\nNow the reason for that long story is...... If you are going to serve roast potatoes serve roast potatoes, not two little bits of potato that if I had to guess came out of a bag frozen, were quickly thrown through some oil and then put on a plate and served.\\n\\nYes doing it right is time consuming, yes it can be a bit of a pain, but if a chain in the UK can do it day in and day out serving thousands of meals a day,there is no reason why a little restaurant cannot get such an important part of the meal right.\\nFor this reason and this reason alone they get marked down, is that mean, well no it's not.\n"}, {"label": "very negative", "sentence": "Text: I have ordered from Rosati's MANY times in Wisconsin, and having just moved to the area, was SUPER excited to see that there was one near me!

Here is why:\\n\\nOrder: Super stuffed pizza with extra cheese, garlic, green peppers, onions; chicken salad (I know....but it was for my girlfriend!!); Breaded mushrooms.\\n\\nDeliver time was over an hour and 20 mins....but if you KNOW Rosati's, you know you pay a little more, wait a little longer....but the food is SO worth it!!!\\n\\nFOOD: Under cooked. I have ordered the super stuffed pizza many times....with more toppings...and it has usually been delivered hot, crusty, gooey....PERFECT.  But there is a difference between a crunchy crust with a chewy center and simply being undercooked.  THIS was undercooked....the crust was still dough and the center was cool, with the cheese not completely melted.  The breaded mushrooms were the same....the breading was very thick and not completely cooked (the batter was still batter inside and the mushrooms were cool). I did not finish either the mushrooms OR the pizza...and trust me, I ALWAYS finish my food!  I ate two pieces and my girlfriend had to try to heat it in the oven........kinda defeats the purpose.\\n\\nThe chicken salad....? Seriously...who cares. Unless you have a fitness buff girlfriend, you won't order a chicken salad from ROSATI'S....and if she is a fitness buff she obviously won't care what it tastes like.\\n\\nWhat got my goat the most was when I called back.

The artisan bread was tasty, but the style was more homemade than artisan.  They were rolls like the kind you could make in your oven at home.  Truffle popcorn is a huge trend right now, and I was glad to try their rendition.  It was natural popcorn, a little salty and a hint of truffle.

My wife, not being a fan of cream sauces, asked if she could simply get Spaghetti Bolognese instead of the tetrazzini.  She was told that everything is pre-portioned so that you could not swap.  Ok, whatever...she ordered the Bigoli Bolognese.  Because she's pregnant, she can't eat cold cut meats and asked if they could \\\"hold\\\" the meat on her salad.

The quality seems to have decreased significantly.  I would have rated it outstanding two years ago, good last year, and below average currently.

My wife ordered the fish special and was quite disappointed.  The service was adequate, but spotty.  We requested additional bread, was told it was coming, but it never arrived.  I was treating two additional friends for dinner, so I asked them to bring me the check.  Instead a different person dropped it off next to my friends, which was embarrassing.  It turned out to be the check for a different table.  When they brought the correct check, they once again dropped it off my my friends, forcing them to have to awkwardly hand it to me.

While in Phoenix recently I visited this studio twice, and will give my feedback focused to those who are already knowledgeable about what this style of yoga is like*.  This is really more of  a 4.2 star review, with points off only as a motivator for future excellence!\\n\\n+1 Star - Intro.  I have always felt that a one week intro is not enough time for new folks to figure out if they like this type of yoga.  Two weeks for $20 is a more than fair deal, even if you have to BYO yoga mat or rent them for $2 per day (It seems likely that most own their own mats if they are at the point of experimenting with Bikram so $2 seems reasonable to me).\\n+1 Star - Energy.  The energy of a yoga studio is one of the most important reasons to keep going back.  This place has quite a few loyal patrons.  They keep coming back because they love the teachers and the other folks there.  That positive vibe would keep me coming as well.\\n+ 1 Star - Heat/Humidity.  Just right - not too hot, not too tepid.  I liked it.  I have to admit, I like a lower humidity, too, so while some might complain that this studio was not humid enough, I was happy.\\n+ 1 Star - Parking.  Free and lots of it, as the world should be.\\n- 1 Star - Location.  Next to Domino's pizza? The devil!  Also, rather poorly signaged in the mall, all in all.\\n- 1 Star - Changing Facility (ladies).  I hate to be like this, but I was super disappointed in this aspect.  One shower?  One loo?  Okay, one sink, too, but that was rarely used.  The wait for the shower could get a bit long.  Some folks obviously did not have an idea of how long a \\\"brief shower\\\" is (even though the request is posted on the wall to respect shorter showering times). Also, there are only about a dozen little lockups to put one's things in.  There is a door in the back of the space that leads to the washer/dryer, so the folks doing that have to traipse through the changing room to get access.  It seems to me that the layout was poorly thought out and now it just is what it is.\\n+ 1 Star - Mix.  I like me my classes when there are men and ladies, not just a bunch of uber-babes and my fat ass.  So it was great to see a range of bodies and genders.  There was everything from the smokin-hot \\\"Gumby\\\" girl (damn her and her double jointed-ness!) to a more older Af-Am gentleman (in the front row! you go, bro!), an attractive 30-something paraplegic man (also front row! I love this place!) to the adorable college girls in worse shape than me (they may be young, but all those margaritas have aged 'em).\\n+1 Star / - 1 Star - Cleanliness.  The place did not have too bad of a funky monkey Bikram-y smell.  This in spite of the slightly home-spun vibe of the studio over all (which can often lead to a less than vivid attention to dirt here and there).  The walls are a pasty grey purple, an unfortunate choice of color that makes my mind just think of... dirt.  However, the corners of the toilet and bath area seem free of scunge, the mats appear to be sanitized more vigorously than many other studios, and I did not see nasty icky \\\"what the hey-all is that\\\" on the carpet in the main studio.\\n+1 Star - Retail.  They have a great selection of yoga clothes and mats, which I was pleased to see were at pretty internet-range prices.  Water is available to buy if you forgot it, and of course towels and mats to rent ($2 each).  They do some good deals on packages, too, so be sure to check that out.  I find the pricing competitive.\\n\\nI will definitely come back to this studio when I am next in the Phoenix area, and you will like it here too.\\n\\n*If you aren't familiar with the Bikram style, read the other reviews here and take a look at the website before you go so you won't be surprised/horrified.\n"}, {"label": "neutral", "sentence": "Text: Aureole is very pretty -- a wide open main room with a several-story high ceiling, candlelit elegant tables and dim lighting (which could be \\\"intimate\\\" if you were on a date, but is just a little dark if you're trying something new and actually want to see your food), and of course the elevated entryway bridge and stairwell (there's also an elevator) and the four-story tall wine tower.

First, instead of filing off the old acrylic they way my usual salon does, this guy chipped it away with nippers. I know every nail tech has their own preferred ways of doing things, but doing it like this hurts, and it really chews up the natural nail. Then, to shorten the length, he chopped them off with a nail cutter instead of filing them. Faster, but in the process he broke my thumb nail, which he then informed me had have all the acrylic removed as a result. THEN he charged me for a nail repair- for the nail that HE BROKE. It's not a lot of money, but it annoyed me... a LOT ... that I had to pay for a problem he created. After the fill, I had the world's fastest pedicure. Another woman, who was his next fill client, was getting a pedicure that started 15 minutes before mine started in the chair next to her. My pedicure was done before hers. Seriously- it was MAYBE 15 minutes total. Now there are times when I don't mind someone who's fast, but come ON. A fifteen minute pedicure??? It's supposed to be relaxing! He didn't leave out any steps, mind you, and it looks ok, but he literally flew through the whole process, not really paying attention to details or really doing anything more than cursory, superficial work.

It's a great place to just really sit down, and enjoy a good drink or snack with friends. You come in, and you expect it to be a very fun place to go.

After sitting outside for a few minutes, the owner came out and explained that due to a licensing and ordinance issue, he wasn't able to serve us outside. \\n\\nApparently the city has been giving this place some trouble, and that's a true shame. This corner has seen more than its fair share of businesses come and go; I'd love to see someone anchor-in and launch a truly successful venture here. But if the city and urban development committee are going to be sticklers and uncooperative, it seems destined to struggle. (end of editorial rant)\\n\\nWe moved inside and grabbed seats at the bar. The barstools were pretty cool - they featured old-time tractor seats and were nice and comfy. We browsed the laminated, single-sheet menu and opted for the Bucky Bites, and the Badger Feast. Beer selection was limited to bottles; Ranger for me, Blue Moon for my friend.\\n\\nAfter a minute or two the owner reappeared and apologized for the heat. Apparently the air conditioner had been on the fritz; it was since fixed, but the building was taking a while to cool down. Totally understandable, and not a big deal. We appreciated his candor.\\n\\nBucky Bites arrived - a soft pretzel cut into bites, fried, and served with a small ramekin of nacho cheese sauce. I gotta' say - these were unique and tasty. A guilty pleasure for certain. Well worth the $3.50 price tag. . \\n\\nAs we were eating the bites, round three of bad news came: they were out of chicken. They offered to provide extra portions of the other items, to which we accepted. Not a big deal.\\n\\nThe plate arrived after a short wait, along with sides that included baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad, and a large piece of cornbread.\\n\\nFull disclosure: I'm not a fan of baked beans, potato salad, or most coleslaws. I sampled them all, however, and shockingly liked the potato salad best. It had hints of mustard, and I appreciated the scallions. The beans were slightly sweet, slightly bacon-y, and pretty decent for baked beans (again, I'm not a fan, so I don't get excited by them). The slaw was ok. Portions of the sides were huge - more than enough for 3-4 people. Why they gave us so much is beyond me. On to the platter... \\n\\nBrisket: thick slabs of brisket with a bit of sauce spread over top. Very moist; our pieces consisted of some fattier pieces and some leaner pieces. The fattier ones literally melted as you ate them. The lean ones were still moist. Unfortunately, I didn't detect any evidence of bark or smoke. They were super moist, but I want some bark and some smokey bite. I weren't sure if the brisket had been smoked or roasted; the owner confirmed the brisket was smoked for around 12-hours, which is fairly standard. Unfortunately I didn't pick-up on the smoke (or the rub/bark). \\n\\nRibs/Rib tips: by far the star of the show. Excellent smoke ring, nice rub, and good mix of meat and fat. These definitely tasted as if they had spent some time on the smoker. Very few bones - I think we must have received more of the rib tip than the spare rib section. \\n\\nHam & bacon: these struck me as interesting, because I'm not used to seeing them on a BBQ menu. The ham was a bit dry and tasted like ordinary ham. The bacon was a bit fatty but really tasty.\\n\\nPulled Pork: I was so disappointed. Like the brisket, there wasn't any hint of a smoke ring or a rub, nor any real smoke flavor. I inquired as to whether or not the pork was smoked, and the owner again shared info about the technique, which included the use of a pressure smoker. Super interesting, and it was certainly very moist, but the smoke, rub, and bark were absent. \\n\\nDining friend had a few bites of each; I polished off the rest of the plate, so it wasn't bad BBQ, it just wasn't bursting with any of that smokey goodness. And while I can pack away food with the best of them, I didn't feel like the plate was \\\"overwhelmingly big.\\\"\\n\\nWe had an opportunity to chat with the owner and found him to be extremely passionate about BBQ and his business, as well as very interesting and incredibly friendly. To hear about the effort he's gone through with the business was both inspiring and frustrating at the same time. It really sounds like he's getting nit-picked by the city over things that absolutely shouldn't matter.\\n\\nIt also seems like we were there on an a-typical night, so we'll be back to give them another try.

After eating there, I have to say, Best Sushi in Charlotte is a pretty hard argument to make. \\n\\nI ordered a miso soup, house salad, Firecracker Roll, and a Volcano Roll.  Below are my thoughts on each.\\n\\nMiso Soup:  Watery.  Very little flavor with mini tofu pieces.\\n\\nHouse salad:  Dressing was good, but the lettuce was brown and tomatoes were not yet ripe.\\n\\nVolcano Roll:  Menu said it had lava sauce on top.  i guess my image of lava sauce is a deep red chili paste sauce.  Their version was some type of congealed slop with a sweet (rather than spicy) taste with waaaayyyy to much tossed on top of the roll.  Gross.\\n\\nFirecracker Roll:  The best of the night.  The sauce was redder and thinner than what was on the volcano roll and was more in line with what I would think of as lava sauce.  Still, the tempura breading was pretty thick and was too overpowering for the tuna. \\n\\nFinally, service was friendly, but I sat at the sushi bar.  There were no chairs at the center of the bar with a wooden panel that could easily hold the sushi going out.  However, this held the stand to put the tickets on when servers picked them up.  The sushi was placed directly in front of the patrons sitting at the bar, so I spent most of the night with servers hanging over me either waiting for the orders, or picking up the orders...directly in front of me.\n"}]
